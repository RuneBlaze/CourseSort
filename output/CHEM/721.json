You can take it before 420, but I would only suggest doing so if you're extremely comfortable with your proficiency in organic chemistry. On the plus side it makes Chem 420 seem more like a review.","He's funny and a good teacher if you go to his office hours, read the book, and do the homework, etc... It's difficult to do well in any class if you don't prepare well, especially orgo2.
