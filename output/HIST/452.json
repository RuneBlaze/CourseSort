She was extremely kind and helpful. The class was interesting and she made it very enjoyable.","Extremely knowledgeable about the subject, very interesting, and if you are interested in the Renaissance, then you will love this class.  However, she expects a lot out of the students, and expects you to thoroughly understand the material.  Exams are essay format and graded critically and are VERY difficult unless you study intensively.","The lectures teach random ideas and thoughts and the tests are graded extremely tough.  Don't go into class thinking an &quot;A&quot; is automatic--it seriously has to be earned.","Knows her stuff, is extremely amiable, in a grandma-ish way (she also looks like a grandma). This makes her relatively boring though and tests are blue book and graded rather intensively. Wouldn't recommend, but not a bad choice.","The lectures are really boring... Made me feel sleepy alot.. Exams are okay but long..","Honors 'seminar' on the history of Economics: Bullard is excited about the course material, eager to motivate discussion, and very fair with writing and grading exams. Her required mini-journal/synopses are helpful as well in absorbing the material. Three hours of class in one sitting was rough though, be warned."],"courses":["HIST151","HIST452","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST48H"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
