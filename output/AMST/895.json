Only 4 tests. You don't have to go to class if there is a google doc you can study from. Recitation has homework. My TA was a weird grader (100, 75, or 0 for homework). Cobb is super enthusiastic and the class is really interesting. Would take again. Easy A if you commit a bit","cobb seems very interested in the subject and is eager to help. however, i found the lectures boring and confusing most of the time.","Native Americans in the 20th Century and it was one of the best classes I have ever taken at UNC. it is important to go to class to learn what is important because his lectures can be dense. Very interesting class and it gave me a whole new perspective of native american histroy. TAKE HIS CLASS","Dr. Cobb seems like a really good guy, but he often lectures beyond the class's time frame. Guidelines for his assignments tend to be ambiguous, making it difficult to figure out how to truly maximize your grade. Certainly not a bad class by any means, but his AMST/HIST 235 class was outlined to be more difficult than it should have been.","Professor Cobb is a godsend! He is such a fantastic professor. His lectures are always clear and his tests are not super hard as long as you study for them. He does best in smaller class settings. He is so passionate about what he teaches and he really cares about his students as people. One of my best professors.","Dr. Cobb is by far one of the best professors I've ever had! His lectures are really interesting, and there only homework is a a short reading response due at recitation each week. He also gives out a study guide for the exam! It's a little tough to write a good essay in the 50 minutes you have for the exam though.","Awesome person and teacher. Makes lessons very interesting, but be ready to work. He really keeps in touch with whats going on in recitations with TA's. Very passionate about subject and make his students feel similiarly. However, his tests can be challenging. However he made his two TAs, majors in the subject take midterms, both failed. Yikes.","Even though the class was online, Dr. Cobb made it interesting and interactive through forum posts and video lectures. He replies to emails quickly and is helpful in his feedback, plus the course material is very interesting. Definitely recommend the course and the professor!","Dr. Cobb is definitely a nice professor and very motivated to teach. However, he grades EXTREMELY harsh. I actually went to him several times for him to check over my assignments, and he said they were fine. Then he gave me a 65-75 on them. Do NOT take Dr. Cobb. He doesn't help the way he should, and will never acknowledge your hard work.","Dr. Cobb is an excellent and motivated teacher. If you read the assigned materials and show up to class, you will do well.","What a DREAM BOAT & he sings SO WELL. Plus his class was awesome. I came in knowing very little about Native American history, and I left with a whole new perspective on Native American history (it's NOT like what they taught me in high school AT ALL). Very easy if you keep up with the reading. If you don't read then you're doomed. Best class @ UNC","I LOVED this class, too, and the professor!! Dr. Cobb is such a fantastic teacher. He is so passionate and enthusiastic about the subject. The study guides before exams were very helpful. I Strongly recommend the class to everyone!","Really passionate about his studies and willing to guide students in the right direction when pursuing assignments. Definitely cute, talks to class about his life experiences as a Native American studies professor and former musician. Doesn't like to give tests but likes to make you write \"response\" papers to books and such. Gentle grader.","I LOVED this class and professor! I've always been interested in Native Americans and this class made me decide to pursue the major. He provides study guides before every exam so you know exactly what's expected and is very enthusiastic about all material. I could not have asked for a better teacher. I recommend him/his class to everyone!","Dr. Cobb is great and the class was interesting and exams were straight-forward. He gives you everything you need to know to do well on exams and there is no cumulative final. Overall, the class was easy, but each TA graded differently so how well you do depends on how harsh your TA is. Definitely recommend this class!","Dr.Cobb is literally my most favorite teacher ever. He is so animated about what he does, its incredible. He actually made me decide to minor in American Indian Studies because of the passion he has for his job. I want to be just like him when I grow up! and if I could take the class again, I would. He's really helpful and its an easy class to pass","Professor Cobb is so awesome. One of my favorite professors at Carolina. He gives you &quot;all of the tools to succeed&quot; by giving study guides and if you do them, you'll do really well in the class. He's adorable and funny and keeps the info interesting. I would take the class again if I could!"],"courses":["HIST110","HIST110","HIST235","AMST235","AMST239","HIST110","HIST235","AMST 110","AMST337","AMST124","AMST203","AMST203","AMST203","HIST110","HIST110","HIST110","HIST110"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
