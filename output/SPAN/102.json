I've taken two classes with him (thinking I could pull an A off the second time and got a B+). Oral interview is graded tough and he doesn't give late forgiveness. If you really want to learn Spanish, take his class. Office hours are stellar!!","I did not like professor Kim at all as a teacher.  He is a very nice person but he grades really tough and does not give helpful feedback.  He expects the students to know things that my friend in 203 didn't even know.  His expectations are ridiculous and his exams were the hardest I've ever taken.  My advice: take another professor.","Professor Kim is a great lecturer, but seems to be very unorganized. He is usually very helpful if you go to office hours or come to him with questions in class, but he didn't return any of our assignments on time and fell behind on assigning our oral interviews by an entire week.","While I think Professor Kim is a great teacher for 100-204 Spanish classes, I would caution anyone taking his class for levels 260 or higher. Professor Kim expects a lot from his students and is not very clear in his teachings or instructions to students on assignments.","Great professor. Period.","He is an amazing teacher. Super passionate. If you have questions when you have doubt he will make it clear however he can. Really animated and made class fun. Do outside reading because he discusses everything in class. Office hours are super helpful as well.","Dr. Kim really is a great teacher. He's very passionate about teaching Spanish. He does sometimes make a point when people are wrong, but he doesn't mean to humiliate anyone. He is a good teacher who truly cares that his students learn the material. I would recommend him for 102. (Took it during Summer Session)","U took his hybrid class so I was a little hesitant but it wasn't that bad at all. He really is a nice guy and tries to make the class as interesting as possible. It was shocking how much I learned in a 50 min session. The thing about his class is that everything is evenly distributed so even if you mess up you can make it up. He truly cares!","Not enough speaking. Class did not meet often enough to get a useful grasp on the language. Although English is not his first language, he is easy to understand. Helpful. I strongly dislike the use of online teaching tools - now I can read and write Spanish, but am barely above 101 level in speaking. Very disappointing semester.","He may be OK for 101-204 but I would avoid higher levels with him. He made this class so ridiculously hard. Not to mention boring. And the reviewer who mentioned that he makes a scene when you're wrong about something - spot on. He enjoys pointing out the minutest of his students' mistakes, but the thing is, he makes plenty of them himself! Avoid.","Kim is an okay professor, he is very militant in his teaching style, the main reason I score him low is that when you answer incorrectly he makes a big scene and you feel so dumb for not know the answer. other then that he is a pretty good guy","dr.kim is so passionate about teaching, and it is apparent in his approach. he is quite thorough in his lectures and speaks clearly so that he may be understood. i enjoyed his class a lot - he used powerpoints frequently to coincide with his lectures.i would definitely recommend dr.kim to anyone who wants to become fluent in spanish","He's very animated and loves to teach. Great guy, quite entertaining. The subject matter is kind of a bore, but he tries to make it interesting and fun.","Great professor.  Very enthusiastic, and makes spanish... which i hate, prett fun.  Not a hard professor, there is a midterm, a &quot;mini&quot; midterm, and a final, plus participation and a presentation grade.  An overall nice guy.

He is very funny and always encouraged us to participate in class. He does get visibly upset when people don't participate in class, but he notices improvements, and they will show up in your grade. Gives a lot of very easy quizzes so those can be helpful. Always willing to offer help in office hours.","I had Huer for 105, which covers Span 101 & 102 in one semester. Therefore, we covered a LOT of material. However, he made it very enjoyable! Huer really wanted us all to participate and do well in his class. Also, he can be really funny and is sure to make you laugh! His English is a little hard to understand, but his Spanish is on point.","His class is gonna be fast paced as he is remarkably fluid in Spanish, but it'll be relatively OK if you actually participate. He takes that part really seriously, and as a result his Spanish classes are usually more social than others.","In-class participation is a must. Prof. Huer is enthusiastic and funny in class! But he's not always clear and many times doesn't understand your questions (especially in English). Not a bad professor, but not the best either.","He is an awesome teacher, really funny in class and makes Spanish-speaking environment not terrifying. Can be a little difficult to understand in English, but his tests are easy.","This guy is hilarious, I would be giggling the whole class. He is super enthusiastic in his little asian man way. Love this teacher and he made my first spanish class soooo good!","Huer's class is easy you just read the book, do online homework every night, and take oral exams. He's really big on participation. There is no final exam- just a group video project","Professor Huer is extremely helpful, funny, understanding and nice.  His spanish is slightly mumbled at times & though and his English is not necessarily the best, he is always eager to help students!  There is daily textbook homework that's completed online, which is not complicated. The exams are oral.  The final includes making a 15 min. video","Very nice and helpful, but can be hard to understand at times. The class size is fairly small, and he is pretty good at teaching one on one.","I love his class. He is enthusiastic and funny!"],"courses":["SPAN203","SPAN105","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN255","SPAN255","SPAN203","SPAN203"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
