She did a good job of making a very boring subject (grammar) pretty interesting. She's prone to go on tangents in class, so be prepared. The class was pretty tough at first, but don't be discouraged because it gets easier. Go to her office hours, she really is there for her students!","Dr. Lee is SO smart and funny.   I was very intimidated after the first day, looking at the syllabus was very overwhelming. We had a paper due on like the third day of class! BUT MAN!!! Once you get used to the work load (which eases up as the semester continues) the class is GREAT!!!! I learned so much and I will take more of her classes.","You can get points taken off for things don't involve your understanding of the material.  Also make sure the Spanish is correct in your papers, the content doesn't matter so much.","Dr. Lee is a cool professor, but can be condescending to all American students. She's traveled a lot and has a lot to share, but puts shame on those who have never been outside the United States and makes you feel ignorant. She's also a pretty funny person too, cracking a joke once in a while. The class was harder than necessary, but still doable..","She is nice and always has interesting stories to tell. But she gives lots of small assignments and pop quizzes that can kill your grade because they are so difficult. She is a good teacher- but spanish 204 is hard and is a huge jump from 203. If coming from high school consider 203 for an easy A.","Quizzes are almost impossible. The information isn't always relevant to what is studied in class. However, she makes the class very enjoyable. She makes you speak in Spanish which is super annoying but helpful! My conversation skills have improved immensely. Just be prepared for hard quizzes and tests. The grammar handbook has examples that help.","Span 102 online- The book is not very helpful IMO because i doesn't give enough examples. That makes actually doing the classwork and homework necessary if you really want to understand the material. Ambiciones Siniestras is ok, if your really good at understanding the long paragraphs and fast talking in videos. Overall, class participation is key.","The worksheets and the PowerPoints were really helpful.  The book was not helpful to me at all.  Ambiciones siniestras went way too quickly for someone who is learning elementary Spanish.  The tests were pretty straightforward, however, if you spelled something wrong or missed an accent mark, you missed the whole question.  Quizzes were helpful.","The videos in the book she uses are sometimes hard to understand and she texts and quizes you on it. There is very little accountability for completing the worksheets which makes you less likely to work on it all week. One class a week is not much either so its easy to put it off. Power points and class are very helpful and cover everything.","The online testsquizzes do not give partial credit and count the answer completely wrong for the smallest mistakes. I liked the worksheets because they helped me follow along with class because I do not work well under pressure of being randomly called on. The professor was very helpful and clear. Overall, great class.","The stuff that helped me within this class was the pronunciation quizzes and powerpoints. The pronunciation quizzes allowed me to see how well I spoke Spanish, which helped a lot. I was thankful the powerpoints were available because sometimes the textbook made the grammar hard to understand but the powerpoints broke it down better.","SPAN 102-Online The powerpoint and worksheets helped me because I could follow along with the class without being put completely on the spot. The videos from the textbook did not help because they went too fast and I could not really understand the story. Unfortunately  testsquizzes do not give partial credit. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.","I had a bad experience with SPAN 204 and SPAN 255 professors and almost began to hate Spanish. However, after having Professor Lee, I've remembered why I love Spanish so much. She's amazing, funny, has a lot of insight on the world through her travels, and a great lecturer. Class is generally difficult, I guess, but she helps you along the way. 55","She's an awesome professor! She has traveled everywhere and can really give you a lot of insight about various countries and interesting facts. If you come to class & try to participate as much as possible, you'll do well. You can tell she loves what she does. The class was at 9am and she was always enthusiastic. She's really sweet. TAKE HER CLASS!","The cultural information provided both before and after the viewing of each movie is very helpful to understanding some of the sayings and humor that appears. It also allows for the student to relate better to the Spanish culture.","Sra. Lee is one of the best professors at UNC. If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it! She genuinely loves her job and that is demonstrated through her teaching. This class does require a significant amount of time outside of class watching movies and completing book exercises.","Professor Lee is great! She is very knowledgable, and always keeps class interesting.","Professor Lee is one of the best Spanish professors I've had at UNC. The content of the class is already really interesting but her comments make it even more enjoyable.","The professor keeps this class interesting with additional information about real life events relating to the movies. Her office hours are flexible and she is available if you need help.","I like this class a lot. Not only is it an advanced level course allowing for fluent conversation in SPanish, the information and history we are learning by watching the films is very interesting. If you like to speak spanish, learn spanish history, and practice a lot-you will do fine and enjoy the class!"],"courses":["SPAN300","SPAN3OO","SPAN333","SPAN333","SPAN204","SPAN300","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102FALL14","SPAN102","SPAN300","SPAN255","SPAN333002","SPAN333002","SPAN333002","SPAN333","SPAN33302","333001"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
