He gives lucid lecture slides and practical reviews for exams. Also, homework problems are simply another version of examples he mentions in class. Despite his accents, Ji organizes the progress of class effectively so that students can quickly follow up.","Lectures are difficult to follow due to his accent, but slides are informative. Much more helpful in office hours or after class.  Homework is considerably difficult and is graded for accuracy. Tests are extremely similar to practice exams. Overall not a bad guy, wants you to succeed and has reasonable expectations.","Very heavy on homework,  which is on the challenging side.  Exams are much easier than homework,  allowed a double sided formula sheet on midterms and 3 double sided sheets during  the final.","Outstanding lecturer, puts a great amount of work into his slides and homework solutions.  He posted the most detailed solutions and sample exams that I have seen at UNC.  Textbook was clear but has gaps ; read his solutions too.  Tough exams; final has more new material than you'll expect.  Difficult class but I learned a ton.","Most lazy professor I've ever had. I expect the professor to workout problems on the board but Ji barely touches the board except to write the most simple concepts like Venn diagrams. The textbook is over 23 years old! He says things like \"I leave it for you to solve\" for very important concepts. BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF, HE SHOWS NO MERCY.","Precooked ppts from the producer of the book. They lack detail on the slide and very poor examples. In class Ji will teach you the vague first half of the material, and expects you to teach yourself the other half. He will only read off the slide. Homework/Test: Book gives simple examples but then HW exercises are impossible. Tests are difficult.","His lectures were disorganized and repetitive to the point that I had trouble paying attention.","nice man, nice course","i had him for stats last year and he was a great professor. the class is definitely challenging, but he rewards you for hard work in the end. if you put in the time, you will do well. and keep up with the homework. i would recommend him","I had him for my FYS class and I loved it.  He is a really nice guy and really cares about your education.","I love this professor! He is awesome. Extremely friendly and helpful.","I had him for a fys and the class was a complete joke. He said he was giving everyone one of two grades: A or A-. He is really hard to understand though so I wouldn't suggest taking him for a regular math class, and he's not a very good teacher. But he's a really nice guy and will try to help you as much as he can.","He is hard to understand and he does not listen when you ask a question, and therfore never answers your question.","He is a good guy.  He explains everything in detail and easy to talk to out of class.  There is homework due pretty much each class.  The first 2 exams weren't to bad at all, but the final exam was rather difficult.  Overall a pretty good class that isn't too difficult.","great class","He doesn't teach much of the class himself, instead using a business student to do it. When he does teach, you don't really need his information for anything. The projects are easy and the class is mostly discussion."],"courses":["STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR664","STATASDF","STOR064","STAT031","STOR064","STOR064","STAT155","006","STAT006P"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
