I would not recommend it at all.  Interesting subject, but terrible execution of  the material.","Professor Wolf is very, very intelligent, and I found her lectures enjoyable and informational for the most part. She expects a lot from her students, so you'll have to work hard for a good grade.","She talks in circles and is extremely bad at communicating what she expects from you. This is an intro. level class and she treated it like we were all upper class psych majors. Seriously, don't bother, especially if you're taking it as a gen ed.","For PHIL 089, you come in thinking it'll be an interesting class, but then you walk out learning almost nothing about evil. She often talks in circles, and her voice is a bit nasaly. It feels pretty much like a BS class. If you get anything out of class it will be, because you did it on your own."],"courses":["PHIL075","PHIL275H","PHIL185","PHIL089"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR"]}}]
