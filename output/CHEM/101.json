Class is made up of practice problems and clicker questions with almost a complete lack of explanation. He is decently helpful in office hours.","Dr. Freeman is a nice, pleasant and funny professor. He wants you to understand the material and pass - take advantage of his generous extra credit and optional instruction time. Mostly online homework. If you do not learn well with a flipped classroom (like me), his class will be frustrating.","Chem is killer, it doesn't matter which professor you have. Freeman is incredibly talented and very fair. If you really take the time to go to his office hours he will help you. He's trying to pass you. He gives SO many extra credit opportunities and partial credit on tests.

Tests are very similar to practice tests, and there are extra credit opportunities on all of them. Participation matters but there is extra credit opportunities available for that as well. Even though I skipped a handful of classes, my participation score was still high.","If there was a calculation error on one of your tests, dont expect to get it back until the very end of the semester. Expect to learn from the online Openstax book and only do problems in class.

Tests can be very difficult but gives partial credit which is a savior!!!","I though it was great but I had him his first semester, so he was lenient and he might get harder later on","He was a very clear lecturer, and participation was graded through clicker questions. We had a lot of sapling homework, but it's not difficult. Test were fairly easy if you studied. The final is exactly like the three tests from the semester, which makes it easy to study for.

I didn't use the textbook but it might help. He puts practice tests on Sakai. Take them!","I honestly didn't put much effort into this class, hence my grade. The class wasn't too bad, and the lectures were fun. There wasn't much homework, which is why I slacked off so much (also because chem lab killing me). He gives a lot of extra credit but doesn't curve or take off your lowest test grade like most other profs. Clicker quizzes everyday","Dr. Freeman is really laid back and pretty funny in class however, I am not a fan of laid-back teaching styles. He does not give much homework and therefore it is really easy to slack off in class. Put in the work and do the textbook problems and you should be golden.","I loved Dr. Freeman! He's extremely knowledgable and genuinely cares about students. He hosts helpful open office hours and review sessions. He's also super funny, and our class shared lots of laughs. Nevertheless, his sense of organization is a little off. He does offer EC though! On Halloween, we could dress up as elements and get 3 extra points.","Dr. Freeman is a cool and smart guy. He gives tons of extra credit and offers mentor sessions and also group office hours. Despite this, the class requires tons of work outside. Lectures get confusing, and he could probably be clearer. You have to do a lot of self teaching outside of his class.

He truly cares about each and every student, and he is always willing to help. He's pretty funny as well (he makes a lot of Chemistry jokes). The Sapling and ALEKS are tedious, but are relatively easy. His exams are straightforward and clear-cut.

I could have retained a lot more information if I had to fend for myself. She is able to explain things in multiple ways and she is very clear about assignments and communicating what she expects from her students.","Benton is an AMAZING lecturer. She relates concepts to personal stories , and the material really sticks. She's young, tries to stay hip, and cares about her students. She tries her best to make tests fair, and my only complaint is that the multiple choice final ruined my grade because there was no partial credit. Had an A all semester until then.","Laura Benton is probably one of my favorite professors at Carolina. She is super funny and makes an 8 am worth going to. Do the work and you will see results. The Chemistry Central Science book is essential to doing well in the class. Final is cumulative and much harder than the semester exams. Be aware.","She is fun in the classroom, but super unorganized outside of class. Cancels her office hours all the time. Exams are graded super harsh and carelessly. Worst professor I have ever had at UNC.","Great person, has fun lectures, just made sure you actually go. EVERYDAY! Her class is not easy but she gives so many resources that a good grade is not impossible. Use the resources, keep up with everything and you will do well. Just dont procrastinate, work on something everyday. Also do not lease Sapling till the last min.","Benton is a great professor, however, she messes up when doing problems (especially ones that are math intensive). Also, she takes off for sig figs on tests which adds up and brings you down from an easy 100 to an A-. Easy class overall if you watch sig figs. Beware of final. you can go in with making A's and come out with a B average.","If you have the chance to take Benton, do it! She's great. She is an amazing teacher and really made me enjoy chemistry, which is usually my least favorite subject. Her guided notes are super helpful and as long as you do the hw, Sakai quizzes, and PollEverywhere questions, you should be good. Tests are a lot harder than practice problems though.","She was super nice, very clear, and helpful. She explains concepts very well and made the lectures enjoyable. Her tests were straightforward and just like the examples done in class but she can be a stickler for certain things (having thorough explanations/ sig figs) so her tests aren't uber easy but still fair.","She gives guided notes that are amazing. She will tell you things to focus on for the tests and posts old tests to practice with. If you do these you'll be fine. Hard class, but she does everything she can to make it enjoyable. She even brought donuts after we lost the national championship. Love her and love the class. The homework is also great.","Not an easy class, but if you work hard you will do well","I loved Professor Benton! She is super helpful and cares about whether or not you know the material and is an amazing professor. Do the homework. Also it is helpful if you print out the PowerPoints ahead of time to use as notes.","Ms. Benton is very helpful and gives email updates on what's upcoming, which is very useful and nice. However, I don't like the way she lectures. She uses PowerPoints heavily and is sometimes clear, but also she blows through a lot of difficult material, so you must work a lot with the book or already know it from AP Chemistry. Do the assigned HW!!","This is a great review of AP Chem and Benton keeps class interesting. She always has the students best interests in mind and it shows. There is poll everywhere and a lot of quizzes, but these end up helping your grade a lot! You will learn a lot if you take benton, but you'll also work a lot.","Super sweet","She is an amazing woman. She will go out of her way to make sure that the concepts are being learned adequately and tries o help bump up grades if possible. Her office hours are hard to come by, but if you read, do the homework and come to class attentive you will understand the material.","Prof. Benton was a fabulous introduction to the UNC faculty. My first semester at Chapel Hill saw several unfortunate events on campus, including an armed gunman on campus and a suicide... She was understanding and supportive of her students and genuinely cared about us. The class wasn't easy (you will work hard), but she is great. I recommend.","Her tests were hard and graded with extreme specificity.  Also, she doesn't curve at all. Overall, the tests were tough, but she was willing to help out if needed. Daily online quizzes and daily poll everywhere questions mean you can't slack off. Tough, but better than the other CHEM 102 profs.","She's super nice and very helpful, and definitely wants as many people to pass as possible with the right amount of work put in. She makes lots of practice readily available for tests and her lectures are usually pretty interesting.","Please do the practice exams and the practice textbook problems before each exam. If you do, then you'll at least get a C on the test. Chemistry is a hard subject already, so she understands this. She really tries to make the class enjoyable and is helpful.","If you do the homework and show up to class, tests should be no problem.
