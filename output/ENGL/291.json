Brit lit class hoping to better understanding some of the best literary works the English language has to offer. Dr. Langbauer's lectures are incredibly long and can be very confusing at times (she jumps around a lot). I think that she really tries, but the large lecture format of this class needs to be changed.","I've had three classes with Dr. Langbauer and loved every one of them. Her classes gave the freedom to engage in research and projects that I not only enjoyed, but yielded more than just an end of semester paper. She has taught me much and is the reason I was able to go on and publish one of my first essays.","So, I'm not done with the class yet and may end up getting a good grade, but wow. She's extremely knowledgeable and seems like a nice person--but that's not what makes a good teacher. Her midterms are preposterously hard. No matter how much you might study, it's all extremely specific, dumb things. I'm learning very little. Steer clear.","I adore this professor! Her lectures were entertaining and very informative. Her class was a very healthy balance of a straightforward, multiple choice midterm, a couple papers, and a short essay final. The only issue is that grading is up to the TAs, so your experience there could be good or bad.","Adorable, just adorable. She's a great professor - funny and engaging, she really makes an effort to entertain students while educating us. You *have* to do the reading to do well in the class, and the multiple choice midterms are tricky, but otherwise a great professor.","For Langbauer's class she leaves the grading to the TAs: not cool. Instead try to get into a class where the professor grades your work. It may be harder and your grade may not be as high, but you will gain more from the experience.","Dr. Langbauer is a mildly entertaining lecturer but she is prone moralizing and only presents her own reading of a work. She is very knowledgable but if you care about the subject this can get annoying. You MUST read all the books but they're some of the best books ever written. For an English class the writing is minimal and the grading is fair.","I hated this class -- Dr. Langbaur's multiple choice tests are demeaning and only care about straight facts. They are extremely poor indicators of whether or not you've actually learned. Her power point presentations over animated and all of her lectures are sporadic, incoherent, and feel like a waste of time. Not for the serious student.","Easy class if you're not a slacker student. Lectures are hard to follow sometimes but she makes really quirky powerpoints that provide entertainment. Def need to do all the reading to do well on her tests, which are all multiple choice and can be tricky sometimes. I've had her twice and have enjoyed both her classes.","Enthusiastic and happy teacher, with slightly tricky midterms but awesome reading material.  The powerpoints made me giggle.","No attendance policy.  I went to maybe two of the lectures and only to a few of the recitations the entire semester and somehow still managed to get a B in the class.  Two multiple-choice midterms (that are curved very generously), a paper, an open-book/note final, and a recitation/participation grade.  If you make any effort whatsoever you should","She was very nice, very well informed, a pretty good lecturer.  the only problem i had in this class was with her TAs.  Tests were a little difficult but there was a nice curve.","Childrens literature class was great. interesing power points.  nice lady, pretty easy multiple choice/ short essay exams (3).","the powerpoints are annoying, her witticisms leave something to be desired... but she is unpretentious, kind, sincere, and knowledgeable on her particular area of literary study, which is a pretty interesting one.","extremely knowledgable, energetic, compassionate, decidedly NOT pompous. a natural teacher and a genuinely nice person. oh, and the powerpoints are amusing (charmingly outdated) if you don't have a stick lodged in lodged in your hindquaters.","wow. she gives new meaning to the word pompous. rather than actually lecture on anything that mattered, she chose instead to do stupid power points with all the moving cartoon characters added in as she read from an essay about the subject."],"courses":["ENGL338","ENGL291","ENGL291","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL284","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENG43","ENGL38B","ENG43","ENGL43","ENGL43"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":291,"section":603,"class_nbr":13882,"title":"HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATED TEXTS","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"303A","days":"F","time":"09","instructor":"Augustine,Nora Katherine","load":"100","rank":"RA","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2125397","fname":"Nora","lname":"Augustine","quality":"3.5","easiness":"1.0","help":"1.0","clarity":"1.0","topTag":"Skip class?
