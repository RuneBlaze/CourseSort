The tests were much harder than anticipated, but you retake it with a group so your grade balances out. She also doesn't take attendance so it's your call to show up or not.

Easy to do well. Definitely more interesting then GEOL 101! She does like to use big words but overall good","This class seems stupidly easy in the beginning- like basic middle school geology. But the exams are absurd and you'll have no idea what she's asking for, even though you know all the content entirely. After exams you'll be so confused.
