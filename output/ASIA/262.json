I took it as a first semester freshman and received an A in it without too much effort. I only completed around 50% of the readings because she assigned so many. It fills a lot of gen-eds so it's definitely worth taking.","Professor Lothspeich is one of the very best professors at UNC, and I am saying that as a senior. She is a very kind and fun person and made class interesting and interactive. A word of advice though; dont mistake her kindness as weakness, shes definitely not gullible.","Dr. Lothspeich is super knowledgeable and passionate about South Asia. She had a tendency to  go on long irrelevant tangents. This sometimes lead to her being unclear/confusing but if asked she would clarify. Her tests and quizzes were very fair and she was always willing to clarify what would be covered by a quiz or test. If you read, you'll be OK","Overall, she's an easy grader as long as you are putting in effort. Go to class, complete the readings, and add to class participation. That's it! She does not expect students to be perfect, just expects them to try.  So as long as you try, you should be fine. The subject is interesting. She does tend to talk a lot but it's all passion.","She is very passionate about the subject and gives interesting lectures. Have to read the books and watch the films to do well, but if you do it is an easy A.","Professor Lothspeich is a nice, well-intentioned woman, yet shes extremely self-indulgent and long-winded. I don't really enjoy her class that much, and I often feel shes not really teaching us anything, just repeating information she knows about india. she also assigns hefty readings (a book in a week is not uncommon)","Just make sure you pay attention in class, she's a good professor.","She might be a nice person underneath, be she acts as though everyone is out to get her.  Also has a tendency to remember things that never happened.  Just something to look out for."],"courses":["ASIA152","ASIA382","ASIA382","ASIA152","ASIA262","ASIA261","ASIA261","ASIA331"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
