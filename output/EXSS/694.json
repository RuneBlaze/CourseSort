The tests are easy as long as you are able to memorize, no surprising or trick questions.  The lectures can get kind of boring, but not bad.  Beware of TAs though, the days that the TA teaches are awful and I could barely pay attention."],"courses":["EXSS175","EXSS175"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
