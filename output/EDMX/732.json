It's super easy and you can really have a ton of control. Her grading system seems confusing but literally everyone has the grade they want. She's super knowledgeable about the subject and the class is really interactive.","Leigh Hall the Associate Professor of Literacy Studies  was the worst instructor I have ever had.  She grades harshly with no explanation as to what you did wrong.  I learned more about her yoga schedule than the guidelines to conduct research.","Professor Leigh Hall is a tough grader who does not provide strong feedback to assist students to improve their grades.  She was never there during her scheduled office hours.  I will not take another class with Leigh Hall.  She does not discuss the subject being taught but her divorce.  I learned nothing about the course subject matter.","When I think of Leigh Hall's class I have anxiety attacks.   She would complain to the students that the we assignments submitted were incorrect.    Students felt uncomfortable asking questions because she humiliated them for not understanding the subject being taught.   The textbook was helpful but Professor Hall said the textbook was incorrect.","Professor Leigh Hall had to be the most uncaring insensitive in the program.  Not one assignment met class expectations or match the syllabus.  Assignments changed frequently and she would forget what she originally said.   She was annoyed when students asked her questions on assignments.  I will not take another course with this professor.","Professor Leigh Hall was the worst instructor I have ever had.  Saying class assignment were confusing is an understatement.   The entire class had no idea what was expected from the assignments she would attempt to explain.  Don't bother going to class,  she will not pass you.","Professor Hall was the most confusing instructor I ever had.  Additionally, she was never free to assist us during her scheduled office hours.    She would consistently change the directions of the assignments and then forget what she said.  When students asked questions she would become frustrated and embarrass the student.","I did not enjoy this course at all.  This instructor did not teach us about the subject. She would change the assignments in the syllabus and forget.  When the class would get upset she would explain she was going through a divorce. We did not learn about English but her personal problems. It was extremely unprofessional.","This class was very confusing. It was difficult to understand what was expected of us.  The syllabus would have one set of instructions and Professor Hall would change the instructions but forget what she said.  When the class would address concerns she got angry and annoyed.  I did not enjoy this course or instructor at all.","I have to agree with the other peer reviews.  The class was very unorganized and the class did not meet syllabus requirements. We did not read the required text and had to purchase another book. I will take an online than a class with Professor Hall's again.","Throughout class was unorganized. Directions for assignments were inconsistent. This cause students to be confused as to how to properly complete assignments. The course expectations and syllabus guidelines were not met.","Not a good instructor at all.","Avoid taking classes with this instructor at all cost. She forgets the assignments she gives students.  Bad mouths them on her personal blogs, facebook pages and twitter. She is more interested in Yoga than doing her job as an instructor.","Leigh was an amazing teacher and by far the best I ever had in the elementary program. She really cares about her students and wants you to do well.","No Comments"],"courses":["EDUC511","EDUX699","EDUC51","EDUC51","EDUX622","QUAL2566","QUAL2234","EDUX62","EDUX62","EDUC51","EDUC51","EDUX622","EDUX622","EDUC51","EDUC51"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
