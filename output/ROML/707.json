Very funny, understands what he is talking about, and can effectively communicate with people who are new to the subject of film.","This guy is really friendly and funny, and I enjoyed his lectures. HOWEVER, be aware: I hated this class. The class starts with a thirty minute lecture, followed by a movie. \"Oh! a movie? It can't be that bad!\" But it is. I enjoyed about half of the movies we watched, and most were around two hours long. For 3 credit hours, this class isnt worth it","Excellent teacher and absolutely hilarious! Attendance and participation matter, and classes are reading intensive, so if you're not willing to come prepared for class or not willing to learn anything, don't take this teacher. Classes are also fairly writing intensive, but not unbearably. He's good at not bashing a dumb comment, but NO SLACKERS!","Terrible correcting essays."],"courses":["SPAN260","CMPL144","CMPL144","SPAN361","SPAN372"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
