Late to every class, very unorganized, & falls way behind on schedule. He had an obsession with teaching us regression analysis (not in class description). The little amount he did teach, he was repetitive & didn't prepare us for the research paper or exam. We didn't learn for a month once. Wouldn't recommend."],"courses":["POLI416"],"courseRatings":["POOR"]}}]
