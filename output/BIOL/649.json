He does tend to get on tangents but is overall a great professor.  I always enjoyed his lectures, although they do switch professors half way through the semester for this class which was kind of annoying.","VERY passionate about his subject, and he knows his stuff. I'm not going to lie, he does go on tangents and it's a little fuzzy until he gets to his main point. However, he's very knowledgeable and makes an 8 am genetics class worth it. He's bad about answering emails though... and his second exam was a lot tougher than the first. Very nice man!","Hard class. Make sure you get the assigned readings done and pay attention to details he not only makes his exams from lecture but a lot of it comes from the readings. Hard exams.","He was obviously very knowledgeable but not able to communicate ideas to the class.  He jumped from subject to subject during lecture so it was hard to follow and take notes.  His tests were hard, but if you paid attention in class, read the textbook, and reviewed masteringgenetics, they were fair.","He liked what he taught but was very disorganized. He's one of those professors that's definitely a great researcher, but NOT a good at teaching. He assumes that you know about a LOT of things beforehand. The exams were extremely ambiguous and hard, especially the 1st one. Also, he never showed up to class on the days we had exams. NEVER.","He is a nice guy and means well and is very passionate about what he teaches. That being said he is very tangential in his lectures and kind of disorganized, so it ends up being quite confusing. Exams are crazy hard, i know many classmates that thought they had a firm grasp on the material that ended up nearly failing the tests.","He introduces an idea, goes to something else, then comes back to finish his point; the end result is sometimes confusing. Not very personable and his test questions are left fielders (even for me and I had a solid A), be ready for curve balls! But, he knows his stuff big time. Minus a couple of nasty test questions, exams are actually very fair.","Dr. Bloom is disorganized, does not explain concepts well, bounces to another concept without thoroughly explaining the first one.  He writes confusing tests and does not clearly express how he would like the questions to be answered.  Biology is a culture and he doesn't do a very good job in helping students integrate into that culture. Avoid him!","Bloom is not a good teacher. He rambles, and refuses to use any kind of technology to teach except Lego blocks (yeah, you read correctly!) and an overhead projector--he seems quite proud of this, too. Tests are somewhat hard, especially the first one. Do yourself a favor and take the other section of this clas.","I enjoyed Dr. Bloom's lectures much better than Dr. Dangl's.  Bloom went slowly through the more complicated material, which was very helpful.  I wouldn't recommend taking this class because as a pair, Bloom and Dangl make this class very difficult to understand","I'm a double science major and Bloom's class was by far my easiest science class at UNC.  He teaches the complicated parts patiently and the practice tests he gives are very helpful.  Do the practice tests and go to review sessions and this class is no problem.","The material isn't easy, but he's very approchable for questions after class.","I did not think either Kerry Bloom or Jeff Dangl were effective teachers. This class contains difficult material and I would advise taking it with someone else.","Somewhat scatterbrained, but generally a good teacher. Stops frequently for questions and goes slowly through difficult material, very much unlike his colleague (and co-professor) Jeff Dangl. Average-difficulty or difficult tests. Likes what he does, so learning from him is a bit easier."],"courses":["BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL202","BIO50","BIOL50","BIOL50","BIO50"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
