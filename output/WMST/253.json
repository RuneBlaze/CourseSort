In my class, she stuck to lecturing and Socratic dialogue, with occasional quality guest speakers. Passionate, good grader, and wants to get to know you. Sticks to the syllabus, gives clear due dates and mainly written assessments, but attendance and reading are mandatory for a good grade. Do it, and you'll be fine.","Marcie Ferris, really wasn't that bad, however there is another professor teaching the class Bernie Herman, and two TAS, who I highly suggest you avoid. DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS.","Ferris was awesome in this class. However, her AMST 211 class had 4 other teachers with it and they were all terrible. I do not recommend this class because they are not fair at all. I would take another class with just Ferris though.","fabulous! my favorite professor EVER! took 3 classes with her as a Southern Studies major. Marcie is awesome. Take any class you can get with her. ps. She usually brings in food a few times during the semester....","SUCH a great teacher! One of the best at UNC! take any class you can with her!","last comments are accurate. fair grader, she definitely sees that you give effort and grades more so on that. tells EXACTLY what will be on the midterm and final. final was take home. not a hard class. if you don't read the books, go to class and you should be fine. it was fun...take it!","sort of a lot of reading (like a chapter or 2 due for every class), not many tests, just lots of projects due at the end of the semester. So the first half you won't be turning in too much. discussion is 10% of your grade, she likes you to talk. very nice though, office hours are screwy."],"courses":["AMST375","AMST211","AMST211","AMST390","AMST290","AMST53","JWSTAMST53"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
