Reading the textbook was not necessary at all because lectures were very thorough most of the time. The 12 page policy brief was very very taxing. Definitely start working on it early.","One of my favorite professors - ever. She's fair, smart, and sassy. A true gem in the department and school of arts and sciences. Loves her numbers, as she's an economist at heart. Get to know her, take her class, and enjoy... you won't regret it!"],"courses":["PLCY210","PLCH210H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
