Attending class is a waste of time, unless it is one of those last few classes preceding the final. ATTEND THOSE. Otherwise, spend ALL of your time solely reviewing the practice in your course book. Make sure you have those practice exams down.","CJ was a great professor, his lectures aren't mandatory but he was a very funny and warm speaker so I didn't mind going. BUSI 101 is an easy A if you start out strong and build a solid accounting foundation, because the class just gets harder. You don't want to be cramming for his final at the end of the semester, but he curves graciously.","Okay.  I know Skender is a really nice guy, and I love him as a person, but he doesn't teach anything.  I mean it.  I stopped going to lectures completely because all he does is a bunch of problems in the book at breakneck speed without explaining where he got any numbers from.  The only way to pass is to make sure you know the practice exams.","Took this class because I loved CJ and did very well in his BUSI 101 class.  While he's just as fun in this class, his lectures are pretty pointless, as is the textbook, so you live or die by the practice tests, which are just like the actual ones.  The problem here is that he doesn't give final prep.  If you want an easy A, pick another 407 prof.","As a human being, Skender is great. He is enthusiastic about teaching & fills the course with a fervent Tarheel spirit. As a professor, Skender makes BUSI 101 very difficult to turn into an enriching experience. Essentially, after 3 months, I can work through endless accounting problems... without knowing what managerial accounting really even is!","Boring material, but CJ tries to crack jokes (I found them to be groaners). Class itself is easy, but the material is harder. Just do the practice problems over and over and memorize the process; CJ teaches to the exam. Not good for truly learning the material, but good for passing and getting it done. I have never read the chapters and made an A.","CJ is a good teacher and explains the concepts well. Personally, I haven't been to class yet this semester and I have an A average. If you choose not to go to class, you MUST read the textbook (which you should do anyway) and WATCH the lectures. Doing this has been worth missing the 8am class. HWs are long, but most TAs go over them with you.","CJ is a great guy who you will love being around. The key to doing well in this class is doing the practice problems that you do in class over and over again. Go to class instead of watching the lectures! Also, expect very long homework assignments after the first midterm. It is very possible to get an A in this class, but you have to work for it.","Very hilarious professor. I love his four plays and his review sessions are very helpful. It's just 8 a.m. class is too early for me to attend, but with his wileyplus assignment and textbooks, it is easy to understand the principles in accounting.","I loved having CJ, the only class time was at 8am but he was always enthusiastic in the morning. He really is a genuine guy and I thoroughly enjoyed the class. My advice is to go to class because otherwise the videos add up and you will quickly get behind. Not a hard class if you pay attention and keep up with the material.","Skender was as good a professor as someone could be in a 400+ student classroom. His clarity in lecturing and examples helped me be successful with learning such a massive amount of content.","Like everyone else has said, CJ is a fantastic professor and human being. He's always willing to help you out; however, sometimes it feels like he moves a little too quickly. It's very easy to fall behind, so keep up with the lectures. Tests are extremely hard but definitely doable.","Amazing guy & accounting rules!","Busi 101 was harder than all of the chemistry classes I've taken at UNC. Skender teaches to his exams and expects everyone to already know the parts that make up accounting. Do the practice problems to save your life!!","STAY ON TOP OF THE MATERIAL! CJ is a very entertaining lecturer and everyone loves him, but the material is still relatively challenging and it is very easy to get behind because there are no required assignments.","Skender is a really nice guy, and arguably makes accounting about as interesting as it could be. Nevertheless, lectures are still a little dry, and it is difficult to motivate yourself to do the homework. This may result in the need to cram a ton for tests. The class is not super easy, but it is not super hard either.","Yo, there is a lot of content in the class, and, as a result, you often find yourself just emulating rather than understanding. As most people say, Skender is a great guy, but the pace of the class and lectures is unforgiving. And there are only two major tests, so... You better memorize everything really well.","You have to attend class and do the homework to do well, but he is a great teacher and it's an awesome class.","Overall, I thought C.J. was a really great professor who worked hard to keep students entertained and make the subject of accounting interesting. He prepares you well for his exams and gives plenty of practice problems. Plus, he shows movie clips in class! If you attend class and ask for help if you need it, you will do well in this class.","Terrible teacher. I have done well at almost every class in KF, and it seems like no matter how much you prepare, it is impossible to understand skender's material. He rushes through problems in class, simply giving you answers instead of explaining them at all. He just wants you to know how to do test questions, not to know the purpose of them."],"courses":["BUS101","BUS101","BUS101","BUSI407","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","ACCT","BUSI101","ECON170","ECON170","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101","BUSI101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"BUSI","catalog_nbr":407,"section":2,"class_nbr":4090,"title":"FINCL ACCOUNTING & ANALYSIS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"McColl Building","room":"3250","days":"MW","time":"11","instructor":"SKENDER,CHARLES J","load":"98","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":50,"enrl_tot":46,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=200269","fname":"Charles","lname":"Skender","quality":"4.3","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"Tough Grader (7)","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","GRADED BY FEW THINGS","CARING","TOUGH GRADER","RESPECTED","RESPECTED","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","HILARIOUS","LECTURE HEAVY","RESPECTED","INSPIRATIONAL","TOUGH GRADER","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","TOUGH GRADER","RESPECTED"],"comments":["BUSI 101 is one of those mandatory classes for a few different majors, specifically the B and J schools.
