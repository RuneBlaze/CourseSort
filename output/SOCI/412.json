He expects you to be ready for a college level workload, but is always there to help. Actually cares about his students.","Doesn't return any graded assignments. No rubrics or assignment descriptions so you are left to figure things out by yourself! Would never recommend his class.","Professor Mouw rocks! He's very relatable and wants everybody to succeed. Although the class required a fair bit of reading, all of it was enjoyable and interesting and the follow-up discussions were extremely insightful and deep.","Such a great guy! He's so nice and he really knows what he's talking about. The class is pretty easy and he doesn't overload you with work. I definitely recommend taking this or any of his classes!","Ted is the best! Take his class you will not regret it!","If you get a chance to take his class then do.  I took a freshman seminar with him and it was my best class I've had yet.  Just do the short assignments before each class and you will do well.  Ted Mouw is the man!","Ummmm.... GREAT TEACHER...still talk to him after course 2 years later. Hilarious, and enjoys what he does! Do your self a favor, and TAKE HIM! You want regret IT!","You know the little box you can check on the end of course evaluations that say &quot;fully deserving of a teaching award&quot;&#63;  This is the only professor where I felt the need to check it.  Funny, interesting, overall a great guy.  Just do the daily assignments (easy) and attend class and you'll get an A.  I wish I could have a class with him every term.","I took his class twice its that awesome, got A's both times  (Social Strat and Economy and Society)both early morning classes, however he is a very funny guy and kept class fun- expect discussion it is part of the grade-always do the homework because its graded and will be apart of discussion as well as on the tests- EASY A if all work is done!","No Comments","Great Teacher!!","This was the best class I have ever taken at UNC!!!  He is a wonderful professor and a really nice guy!","He is AWESOME!!!! There's alot of readings but the class is fairly easy and very interesting!
