His tests questions are very obscure and have ambiguous wording.   if you are good with conceptualization, take this class but don't expect  to get above an 85% (even after understanding everything on his power points).","Konrad is a great guy, but his tests are tough, even if you pay attention in every lecture and take notes. If you haven't had any environmental science or weather classes in the past, I wouldn't recommend starting out with this class.","Geography 111: Weather and Climate... sounds easy right? It's actually much harder than you think. Konrad does a good job of explaining the information in his lectures (make sure to attend lectures because entire tests are based of lectures). He's very helpful in his offers hours and encourages question. Tests are difficult but study and it'll be k","Kondrad is a really nice guy and really does want to help you if you're willing to put in the effort. He knows his stuff and is very passionate. Do be careful though his test are tricky and questions can be ambiguous. I wouldn't just take this class for funzies but if you need it for a major it's an okay one to take.","Not exactly an easy A, or even an easy B. His test and quiz questions seem random and kind of ambiguous. Class attendance is definitely mandatory. A lot of effort has to be put in to get a good grade. Nice guy though, pretty funny.","If you are the least bit interested in weather and need an easy class, TAKE THIS! Konrad is the best...attendance is definitely necessary but you will rarely dread going to class. He really knows and is excited about weather so class is always entertaining. He curves like crazy so it is really hard to not get an A in the class.","Konrad is an awesome professor who loves weather. I had him during hurricane season so it was great to discuss the current weather events. Grades consist of weekly quizzes and 3 multiple choice tests. You have to attend class to do well as all the material is drawn from lecture not from the book. I'd recommend it","The lecture are taught in a very straight forward manner, however the tests are a more applied learning format. Because of this discrepancy it is very hard to study. He does adjust the scale of the test though.","SO BORING!  Don't take this unless you have to... lectures are off the wall and hard to follow.  He does assign a project that REALLY helps your grade! Study A LOT and you might make an A","Dr. Konrad is a really great guy & teacher. He's nice and really passionate about his work. He's really understanding and explains things very clearly.  TA's are really nice. Exams are easy and come almost entirely from the notes.","The price of the text book went up our semester, so he canceled it! He's a little eccentric, but he LOVES weather. Weather and Climate itself was occasionally dull even though I love the subject, but the discussions of current weather events were amazing. I enjoyed analyzing the drought in 2007 every Monday with him.","easy if you come to class","BeSt ClAsS EvEr!! All of the notes are online, so study and get participation points and its an easy A- I didnt use the textbook once, so that saved 70 dollars right there. Plus he will scale tests at end of semester! Konrad is passionate about the material he teaches, and always takes class time to discuss current events on the weather channel!","Kind of a boring class, but the material is fascinating once you get past the astronomy stuff. The info is useful all over. Once you get into the severe stuff, it gets really interesting. However, you must pay attention in class and study the powerpoint presentations in conjunction with the book to do well. Otherwise, it's not a difficult class.","Seriously, how can you not love Weather and Climate taught by Chip Konrad! That man is ultra-qualified to teach this course just by his NAME. but seriously, it was WAY easy if you paid attention at all. He's a really great guy too, and LOVES HIS WEATHER! Take him durring Hurricane season!","No Comments","interesting class...sometimes the test questions seemed random and confusing, but overall, not too bad if you went to lecture and did problems from the CD-ROM","kinda boring but not too incredibly difficult","Konrad knows his weather. He'll show satellite images of current weather and try to forecast storms like hurricanes. 1/2 of test questions comes from cd in textbook, other 1/2 is from lecture material, which can be confusing. Weather forecast game counts as extra credit.","I thought he was great.
