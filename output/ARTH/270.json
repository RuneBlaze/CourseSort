Class is not easy and you must want to learn. Also, forgive her for not returning your papers on time or not following the syllabus. What you get back is a plethora of information that will help you grow as a human being. Kept all her power points and notes. Truly an amazing professor.","She is a very nice person, but if you are a type A personality, her classes will literally drive you insane. Extremely disorganized, does not utilize class time well, and gives assignments at the last minute and still expects you to turn them in. It was a truly awful experience.","I completely agree with the person below me about the freshman seminar, but I still think potential students should take the class if they're interested in art. I learned a lot, contrary to the art major below me, who possibly knew it already.","Dr. Pardo is such a nice woman, but her class was a mess. Syllabus wasn't followed (even though she sent out several edited versions), 1 assignment returned, I didn't know my grade until the very end. She is so disorganized, but somehow regularly remembered to bring food for us! I didn't learn anything and books were boring, and I'm an art major!","sometimes disorganized but she knows this subject hands down and is eager to teach and answer your questions","She's crazy, but really intelligent and knows her history perfectly! If you like Art take her lass but if you don't avoid it like the plague!","Pardo is a gifted woman and she knows more than you will ever imagine about art history.  If you care about your education and want to grow as a person, take her.  Who cares about syllabus and logistics anyway&#63;  She is one of the most knowledgeable professors I have ever encountered.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. for your own sanity do not take it. the syllabus was never followed which we didn't get 4 weeks into the course. she always veered off topic and paid no attention to this course. we got one assignment back and our final grade was 2 weeks past due. she always answered her cell phone and rarely responds to email.","Pardo has no idea how to teach. We got through half of the intended syllabus.  She returned not one assignment, so no one had any idea of his or her grade.  She made many promises she never kept.  Her class was academically pointless. She arrived late EVERY CLASS and was famous for answering her cell religiously during class. AVOID.","Ms. Pardo knows so, so much about Art, and sometimes she gets carried away discussing a detail that she forgets where she started. tangents are frequent. However, if you are attentive,I don't think you'll find her confusing-especially if you  read the book. Don't be afraid of her! her class is well worth taking and I highly recommend it!","The most disorganized professor I have ever had. She handed out the syllabus late; rambles about the course material; and does not care about her students. I almost stopped studying art history, my true passion, because of her. You do not want to be in a classroom with her.","What a wonderful professor!  She was kind, available for discussion anytime, incredibly knowledgeable and very, very entertaining.  She loves what she does and she invites her students to love it, too.  Nevermind that she is late to class.  Nevermind she might not return papers in a timely manner.  She is an inspiration!  and MORE than fair to all!","people complain about disorganization and &quot;scatterbrained-ness,&quot; but that's precisely what made her courses so interesting & informative. the material isn't simple, but it's simpleminded to pretend it could be otherwise, packaged & understood like a math book. A turning point in my education.","So disorganized, always late to class, doesn't finish on time, just shows slides and doesn't even clarify what we're looking at or who made/drew it.. not sure what's on the exams.. stressed the importance of the research paper, yet didn't clarify what we're supposed to write about. so boring..","She's an extremely intelligent woman...so smart she has too much to say and not enough time to organize it all.  Oh yeah, DO NOT go into her office unless you are very very very brave. Food, coffee cups from like, 5 years ago!!!","This was the worst class I ever took. Totally unorganized, lectures were tangential. A knowledgable teacher who doesn't know how to teach.","interesting material, but TERRIBLE class.  very unorganized, and it's always unclear what will be on the tests.  lectures are somewhat entertaining but if you like organization, YOU WILL HATE THIS CLASS.","Slow, uninteresting. We were supposed to receive the topic for a 5-6 page  research paper during a recitation, but it went unmentioned. The topic was given a week later and the paper was still due the same day. Class materials not posted on time.","AMAZING professor. Specializes in Renaissance but seems to know every area in depth. Very interesting lectures, fantastic descriptions of paintings, great conversations in office hours.","Not just scatter-brained...this is the least organized class I've ever been a part of.  The sylabus wasn't even uploaded until two weeks into the semester.  Lectures follow no coherent train of thought and even the TAs  say she's hard to follow."],"courses":["271","ART1","ART079","ART079","ART270","ART079","ART150","ART079","ART079","ART270","RENAISSANCEART","HIGHRENAISSANC","ART56","ART48","ART113","RENAISART","ART32","ART32","ART32","ART32"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
