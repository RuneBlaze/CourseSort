I'm not sure if she purposely makes you feel uncomfortable, but it can feel awkward at times. She is very friendly though and only wants you to excel at Japanese. There was a group project though, so be prepared for that!","I took the Japanese Pop Culture course and am so thankful. It was the easiest A I've made and I loved every second of the course. I'll probably have Aratake again for a language course and I'd be happy to have her. She sometimes struggled with English but her lectures were still pretty clear-cut. She teaches more JAPN courses but I'd recommend her!","She is just your average Japanese teacher.  Just be respectful and do your work and you'll have no problem making an A.","No thank you! She is kinda snobbish. I remember the times she would have office hours at a certain time, and she would make us wait outside until the clock hit that exact time. I felt like she was condescending most of the time.","She's a good teacher and nice.  Just make sure that you respond to any questions she asks you, even if you know you're wrong.","Aratake-sensei is a wonderful professor. Show her you care about the material! She's very friendly. But, I do not advise taking this class if you just plan to slack off. When the Japanese professors know you don't care about the class and are making no effort, they are not happy! I highly recommend her to anyone motivated though! ^_^","No Comments","she is kind and the class is easy","No Comments"],"courses":["JAPN203","JAPN162","JAPN203","JPN103","JAPN101","JAPN101","JAPN101102","JAPN101","JAPN101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"JAPN","catalog_nbr":305,"section":2,"class_nbr":2747,"title":"ADVANCED JAPANESE","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"New West","room":"0103","days":"MWF","time":"14","instructor":"Aratake,Yuki","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["FI"],"enrl_cap":12,"enrl_tot":11,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=716927","fname":"Yuki","lname":"Aratake","quality":"4.2","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"Participation matters (1)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK"],"comments":["Aratake is overall a good professor, but she can sometimes be a little intimidating when you have to answer questions in class.
