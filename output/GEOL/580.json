Xiaoming is a wonderful person and she teaches the material very well. I'd highly recommend for students to take this class whether they are interested in geology or just trying to fulfill a Gen-Ed.

I took the class for the mandatory science credit and was dreading it and she has made the class enjoyable and bearable. Wonderful lady!"],"courses":["GEOL101","GEOL101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
