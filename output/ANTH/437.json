He is super approachable before and after lectures, in office hours, and through e-mail. He cares if you care. I also think he's hilarious.  I'm going to try and get into his future ANTH 143 class. 120 was very easy- novels with reflections for HW, recitation, mid-term, and a final. Super doable","He has a very funny personality! He's one of those professors who will not care about you if you don't care about the class though, so do try on the homework. We only have a midterm and a final, neither of which I have taken yet but believe as long as I study I will get a good grade. Definitely recommend him as a professor!","Prof. Corbett is very monotoned in his teaching. However, he does have an awesome sense of humor which helps cut some of the dullness. He's a super approachable guy and is willing to help in his office hour. Decent amount of extra credit, tests were all multiple choice, and he cares about you doing well. He's willing to help with your grade.","Do not take this professor. The class was so boring-Fell asleep most lectures. Biggest problem is that he is rude and dismissive when asking for assistance and help understanding the material. He knows his stuff- that is for sure- but he vomits material, no room for questions, no time for synthesis. This class made me loose interest in the material","Prof. Corbett is awesome. Willing to work with students, clear about his expectations, and provides great resources. Class can be boring, but he tries to liven it up with his great sense of humor. Great lecturer, almost never reading off any notes, but uses a power point to effectively summarize. Very fair and respectable. Great professor overall.","This is my favorite professor by far. The man is hilarious and keeps you awake with some great humor. He's great to talk to one on one and is willing to work with you on any issues. He doesn't seek to fail you or make your life heard so you can focus on his material rather than stressing over the grade. I signed up for two more classes with him.","Fell asleep in lecture a few times but the material is interesting and easy to understand if you pay some attention. Powerpoints were posted online and comprehensive study guides were posted before exams. Exams were easy if you read over the powerpoints but the essays were boring and not as easily graded. 4 exams total(non cumulative) and 2 essays"],"courses":["ANTH120","ANTH120","ANTH298","ANTH143","ANTH143","ANTH298","ANTH101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
