I've always been really bad at it, but Dr. Shade actually made me enjoy it and I got an A-.!  She is a great professor and really cares about her students.  She comes early on test days to make sure no one has questions.  My only criticism is that she takes forever to grade written assignments.","Professor Shade is so sweet. She genuinely cares about her students and never wants to embarrass anybody. She is ALWAYS smiling, just a ray of positive energy. There are two exams, the final, two presentations, and two compositions total so all in all not a lot of work. Would definitely recommend."],"courses":["SPAN100","SPAN204"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":100,"section":2,"class_nbr":6534,"title":"ELEMENTARY SPANISH REVIEW","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0101","days":"Tu","time":"12","instructor":"LOMAS-LOZANO,BEATRIZ","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["FL"],"enrl_cap":18,"enrl_tot":21,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1377870","fname":"Beatriz","lname":"Lomas-Lozano","quality":"4.6","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Gives good feedback (2)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["The online homework is super long.

She will extend any assignment deadline to make sure you do it right. The homework is online and it is fairly long, but not too difficult. As long as you go to class and small group sessions you'll be fine.","Very friendly and helpful!","Beatriz is very nice and keeps the classroom mood informal and relaxed. She's from Spain so you get practice hearing the vosotros forms.  SPAN 300 is probably the hardest class in the department, but Beatriz really goes out of her way to make sure you understand the material, are prepared for exams, etc.  Super sweet (and also gorgeous!) lady."],"courses":["SPAN105","SPAN101","SPAN105","SPAN300"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
