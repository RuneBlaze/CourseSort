She works with the best students... if you aren't one of those you are screwed.","She is very patient and is good with people who are slow to learn the language. She can sometimes be somewhat confusing with her explanation of some concepts, but that can be easily fixed by a question or two. Quizzes are issued twice a week and are very harshly graded.","Kato-sensei is fantastic. I've had her as my Japanese teacher for two semesters now, and she has helped me so much with learning the language. She's very personable and jovial. It takes a lot for her to lose her temper. She expects people to pay attention, but doesn't grade too hard. Come to class and pay attention, and you'll be fine.","Kato-sensei is a little intimidating, but in general, she's a very sweet teacher. Japanese was a tiring subject for me personally, but if you pay attention, it should be a relatively easy class.","Yuko-sensei was a really, really good teacher! She isn't very picky about how your characters look, and she is very kind if you at least try to work in the class. She grades very easily, but the one thing about the class is that there is a quiz every day, in all of the 101 classes. She is more than welcome to help anyone who needs it.","She has a wonderful cheerful attitude and is willing to help after class if you don't fully understand something. She also encourages students to talk to each other in Japanese which simply rocks.","KATO-SENSEI ROCKS! Only japanese (almost) spoken during all class. She was always very clear and willing to explain the material so that everybody would get it. Just a little bit extra effort from the student. I loved this class!","She is ALWAYS willing to help a student, and is ALWAYS willing to take questions. The class moves at a steady pace, but lots of practice in recitations and class helps. If you can take her, DO!"],"courses":["JAPN101","JAPN101","JAPN102","JAPN101","JAPN101","JAPN103","JAPN104","JAPN101104"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
