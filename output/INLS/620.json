I learned a great deal from his course and you will too if you pay attention. Lectures can be boring but it's the nature of the intro course. He never goes too quickly through lecture!","Probably an interesting class if you like information science. Prof Shaw is nice and is easy to approach. Required reading/reflection for every class. You have to go to class if you expect to do well - there's no textbook. Do the readings and take notes, go to class, and you'll be fine."],"courses":["INLS101","INLS101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
