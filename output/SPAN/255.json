His class is less interactive than previous Spanish classes that I've taken and he likes to talk a lot. However, he emphasized things like accent, pronunciation, and ability to communicate with native speakers that I hadn't learned in other classes and that will help me.","Professor Maisch is a really great guy. He's willing to get to know his students, and it's worth getting to know him -- he's always willing to help you out in a pinch, and he was happy to write letters of recommendation for multiple students in my class. Beware that SPAN204 is tough, and you have to study to be prepared for class, but it's doable.","I learned a lot from Professor Maisch. He is a funnygoofy guy that's super passionate about Spanish.  However, he talks really fast, goes off on tangents easily, and isn't super clear.  If you don't have an affinity for languages or don't have the willingness to work hard, this class may not be for you. He loves the culture and it shows.","Honestly, I found this professor to be quite patronizing... Whenever a student asked for help or clarification in class, he would tut-tut them and make them feel stupid for asking. Not very conducive for a good learning environment or for active class participation, especially when people are afraid to talk in a foreign language already!","Don't get me wrong, he is a very nice guy and loves his job but as far as &quot;teaching&quot;  his class is more like self guided learning.  He will assign something you have never even seen in class and expect you to know how to do it.  Very difficult and challenging professor, very strict on grading.","Good professor, he was helpful and encouraging even to the worst student. I learned a great deal from his class, and his teaching style was effective. Overall good class, and not that hard","Very goofy guy, but energetic enough to keep you interested (even if it is way too early in the morning). Somewhat tough grader, but only because he has to be. I'd highly recommend him."],"courses":["SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN102","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN102","SPAN204"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":255,"section":5,"class_nbr":3153,"title":"CONVERSATION I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0313","days":"MWF","time":"10","instructor":"Noffsinger,Robert Paul","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":20,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":4,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2140345","fname":"Robert","lname":"Noffsinger","quality":"4.0","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["CARING"],"comments":["Robert is a great teacher who really cares about his students and he makes the class super fun.
