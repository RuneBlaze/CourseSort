I strongly recommend that you fight to get into a small, honors class with her, because she will edit all papers and meet anytime.  I would recommend her to anyone, and you should take multiple classes with her because she gives recs.","Dr. Wolfe is absolutely brilliant and one of my favorite professors at UNC.

She is sure to keep you engaged, expose new interests, and help you dive into the ancient texts. Have fun!","Absolutely brilliant professor.

His class is discussion style and almost completely run by the students. He does expect you to read just about every night and submit a reading log. The toughest part was how boring and confusing some of the readings were! McGowan is awesome, but the reading selections weren't","I had him for a first-year seminar and it was absolutely amazing. He's the best professor I've had to date and is very forgiving, doesn't throw the book at you just because he can.","Dr. McGowan is terrific.  He is my favorite professor at UNC.  If you pass up a class of his, you are missing out.","A very engaging, shrewd, and yet also self-effacing professor.  You get the impression there's nothing he hasn't already read.  He's an extremely eloquent lecturer capable of making very abstract topics seem graspable.  A tough grader on papers, but reasonable.  I wouldn't hesitate to take another of his classes."],"courses":["CMPL123","ENGL54","ENGL150","CMPL251"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
