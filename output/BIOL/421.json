Just don't, take it online at any other school. Just not with her. She brings in grant money so somehow they give her access to students. But honestly she should not be within a 20 mile radius of a student. Thank you for singlehandedly ruining my love of microbiology, business it is..","Worst professor I have ever had at Carolina. Every day our lecture consisted of her making general statements that did not match up with the power points. Almost every test you take you will have to resubmit for a regrade because of how many mistakes that are made. I can say that this class has been more stress than it's worth and she needs to go.","go to class, write down everything she says, even if it doesn't sound important (because oftentimes it is). do the practice exams and study in a group. don't approach her outside of office hours without an appt. do all that and you will be fine.","Worst teacher I've ever had. She is condescending, extremely difficult to approach, and definitely not the easiest person to look at. The perpetual sneer on her face was a testament to how she didn't want you to succeed. Oh, the book was of no use either.","This class is a nightmare. Dr. M laughs at her own jokes, runs into her own desk so much, she bruises herself. The class is such a waste! All you do is memorize old test, if you actually read the material you are screwed!I would not recommmend it to my worst enemy!","Horrible teacher.  You will learn very little and be engaged even less.  All you do is memorize old tests because knowing the material from the book won't help you at all.  She even tells you that if you do the reading you will make a C- on her tests.  Condescending, pretentious and not at all helpful.  Read a book on your own.  You'd be better off","If you're a seasoned microbiologist,you'll do fine. ^.&gt; Expects entirely too much on tests.Studying won't help much. Class was at 8,had to come in at 730 to be able to finish exams(90% of people were still there at 845). Grades harshly.Ran overtime often.Memorize old tests;if you want to learn, avoid. Gave us 2 min to do evaluations, of course.","Matthysee is a sweet woman, but the class is very hard, the tests are very hard (all tests are cumulative with difficult tricky questions), unlimited studying may not help you.  Hard to follow but if you need the class only she teaches it.","No Comments","Fairly difficult material.","A difficult professor to get ahold of outside of her office hours.  The difficulty of this class requires some office visits.  If your hours don't match hers, look for a tutor or another course.  She is the only professor that teaches this class."],"courses":["BIOL422","BIOL422","BIOL422","BIOL422","MICRO422","BIOL422","MCRO422","BIO108","BIO108","BIOL1089","BIO108"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
