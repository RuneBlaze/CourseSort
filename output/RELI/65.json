Listen, his topics are difficult to explain and it takes someone with an enormous intellect to get these ideas and concepts across.  He invests a lot of energy doing just that.  He is an inspirational professor and he's a pretty groovy guy to boot.","Prof Zlatko is truly an inspirational professor and someone who knows how to keep students engaged. The class had lotssss of reading but it was mostly very interesting. Really nice professor and a challenging, rewarding course","Z-Man is amazing. He keeps you engaged in all of his lectures and is super funny. He really expects you to talk and answer his questions but if you do the reading then it's not hard. I would take him again in a heart beat","Interesting guy and great class.  His attitude towards the subject makes you want to learn more and keeps your attention.  I would take another class with him!","Z-man is the best professor at UNC. He is engaging and funny. You do have to work for his class, but it is well worth it if you are into Religious Studies at all. Even if you are just a Christian and interested in the early centuries, take his &quot;Varieties of Early Christianity.&quot; Well worth it.","It has been 4 years since I have graduated, and I still have respect for the man. His class was one of the most memorable for me in my career at Carolina.","No Comments","Zlatko is the man!  How dare you attack his accent!  His accent is frikkin cool!  Great guy, one of the best people I've worked with at UNC.","Zlatko is a great professor, and you cannot expect to learn anything from a great professor without doing some semblence of work.  The Id's could be difficult, but if you've done the reading you should be able to recognize the different tones and writing styles.  Overall, i highly recommend Z.","Zlatko's accent isn't that hard to understand.  There is a lot of reading for this class and you have to identify verses on the midterm and final which is a bit rough.  The class is fun though because Zlatko is really energetic and engaging.","This class is a little hard and Z-man's accent definitely doesn't help matters... But he is funny and likeable which makes class interesting, even though its not always clear.  could be organized better","Z tries really hard, but his accent is hard to understand (not to mention his handwriting). I'd avoid his class, the reading, and the exam ID's."],"courses":["RELI217","RELI209","RELI209","RELI217","RELI203","RELI61","RELI200","RELIADVANCED","RELI61","RELI61","RELI61","RELI61"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
