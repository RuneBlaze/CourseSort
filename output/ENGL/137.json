He is one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is very knowledgable and definitely a unique professor. He is always there for his students and helped me develop a higher level writing style. He often goes on tangents, but they are always very interesting. I highly recommend taking his 105 and ENGL137.","Henry is very unconventional. The class is all discussion based and he usually lets the students determine what exactly you will be talking about. No tests and the reading is really unnecessary. He's a cool guy and as long as you participate and he can see that you're trying you will get a good grade.","Henry is great and really smart. He always tells you exactly what to do and lets you revise stuff a million times before you hand it in. I actually learned a lot in his class, even though I am not a huge fan of writing papers. Sometimes, he goes off on tangents but I always find his stories interesting and fun. Wouldn't mind having him again.","BEST PROFESSOR EVER, super understanding. Goes on a few rants in class but always interesting. Take him if you have the chance, you won't regret it!!!","He's a great professor! He gives a lot of busy work in the beginning, though. He requires you to post intermediate steps in writing paper, which can be annoying, but it stopped me from procrastinating. He grades pretty easy, and I think he is looking for improvement.","Fabulous Professor! Although most of the time he lectured on other things that didn't pertain to English, he was very interesting to listen to and is very intelligent. If you show an effort, you will do well in the class. It is possible to get a high grade in his class. You do have to buy the textbook however because you use it a good amount.","FABULOUS PROFESSOR. I loved his class. The material wasn't easy but his attitude and teaching skills make it an easy A. He's wonderful. 1010 definitely recommend!","He's such a chill guy, if you show up to class and write a decent paper you'll get an A. He grades a lot based on effort and he's very forgiving (I was sick for 2 weeks and he let me turn in everything later for full credit) I highly recommend taking him for 105","This class is relatively easy, but it is still not a joke. He takes writing very seriously. A paper was due about every week. Most lectures are completely unrelated to english, but he was an interesting professor.","Super intelligent. Although his instructions are not always clear, he is understanding and willing to help and encourages students to take chances in order to improve their writing. Very practical grader (as in he grades for grammar/technique/coherence instead of content), as well--so you don't have to worry if your beliefs don't match his.","Henry is very interesting to listen to.  Extremely knowledgable and passionate about teaching.  I enjoyed his class and the assignments were few and fairly easy.  If you want him to like you, participate.","Henry is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. I feel like out of all the classes I had my first semester at UNC, he was the one I learned the most from. Don't be afraid to talk in class and as long as you put in some effort, you'll be just fine. Can't wait to take his contemporary lit class!","Professor Veggian is nice but his assignments are really random. His directions aren't very clear and kind of expects you to know all this stuff you are talking about. Talk in his class and ask questions because his assignments are weird.","His courses are very reading intensive but the essays are short, open-ended, and graded easily.  I probably only finished about 4 books this semester and still made an A in the course. The class was kind of weird and I could never quite tell what direction we were going in but overall it was interesting.  Speak up or else he'll pick on you.","dr. veggian is the best teacher that i've ever had at carolina.  if all college professors were like him i'd never want to leave college.  literally he is that friendly and helpful.  take his class if you want to actually learn and succeed.","The class is easy and the material is, too, and if you put forth any effort you will do fine.  The writing assignments are open-ended so it is not very hard to do well on those.  Henry is also very approachable and easygoing."],"courses":["ENGL137","ENGL137","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL137","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL102","ENG122","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL124","ENG122","ENGL122"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":137,"section":3,"class_nbr":16999,"title":"LITERATURE IN A DIGITAL AGE","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Bingham","room":"0317","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"Stewart,Vaughn","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":33,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1195265","fname":"Vaughn","lname":"Stewart","quality":"4.1","easiness":"2.6","help":"2.6","clarity":"2.6","topTag":"","grade":"2.6","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":[],"comments":["Would not recommend this professor to freshmen. Class was based purely on discussion- if you don't contribute in every class you will fail. Also, heavy readings (more than 2 hours daily). Nice and approachable, but very hard.","Easy english class to start off as a freshman. He's really relax and if you have trouble with anything he's really helpful. Good teacher, makes the class interesting and not horrible.","English is sucky but Vaughn was great.  He's a great guy and the class ended up being fun.  If you have the chance, take his class.","Great teacher, I would recommend him. It's not your easiest A, but an A is very possible if you work hard and do all the assignments. He's very nice and encourages you to come into his office hours anytime. He makes class fun and interesting. I hate english classes, but I loved this one. Definitely take him for English 101 or 102.","No Comments"],"courses":["ENGL123","ENG101","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENG101"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
