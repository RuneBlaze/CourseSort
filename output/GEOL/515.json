I never raise my hand because anything you say he will attack. The assignments are easy and there are no tests. Overall he means well and the course is easy to succeed in.","Extremely extremely rude guy.  Hates to be challenged/corrected, and he is wrong a lot of the time.  Tries to shift discussion to his preference for socialism on a daily basis. Rial is the worst instructor I've ever had","he says the book is optional, but the tests are almost completely from the book. he  uses class time to rant about politics, wtf isn't this a geology class&#63; he is also extremely rude and thinks everything students say is dumb to the point of not really listening to what they say","Very knowledgable but tends to get ranty. Not too many assignments but expects a lot. Very poor people skills and very rude to students; there is room for debate as long as he has the final say. He expects a lot and if you don't please him he will insult your intelligence and destroy your spirit for the remainder of the class period.","No Comments","gah"],"courses":["GEOL76","GEOL76","GOEG213","GEOL76","GEOL076","GEOL"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
