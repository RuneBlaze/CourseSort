She's so funny and it's obvious that she's very passionate and knowledgable about what she does. There's not many grades for this class and there's' a 10 page paper, but she's a pretty easy grader and she gives tons of extra credit. She really wants you to succeed.","Gives extra credit. Attend lectures and you'll be alright. Class is fun. She is so young and experienced. It's a great class overall.  10/10 would take again."],"courses":["PLCY110","PLCY110"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
