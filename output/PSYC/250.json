I really learned something and she just wants you to do well. I am going to take more of her classes in the future. Highly recommended.","Dr. Adams is a very sweet professor. She really cares more about students scoring well on tests than about making the material hard. Coming to class is important and her tests are passed directly on class powerpoints. She has a review before every test with some of the test questions. She gives online quizzes (easy) and randomly takes attendance."],"courses":["PSYC250","PSYC250"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":250,"section":1,"class_nbr":2623,"title":"CHILD DEVELOPMENT","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Manning","room":"0209","days":"TuTh","time":"12","instructor":"Ulku-Steiner,Beril S","load":"10","rank":"TA","attributes":["P"],"enrl_cap":180,"enrl_tot":175,"wait_cap":20,"wait_tot":16,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=553414","fname":"Beril","lname":"Ulku-Steiner","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"GROUP PROJECTS (2)","grade":"3.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["HILARIOUS","TOUGH GRADER","GROUP PROJECTS","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["She's awesome. Total sav","She loves her material, but tests are super hard. You can know the book and notes backwards and forwards and still have a hard time. Also, participation in class is mandatory, but class itself is basically just powerpoints. The group project is graded unfairly- she doesn't even watch you present, she bases it off what your classmates saw/thought.","Ulku-Steiner is awesome & has the best taste in style. She's super peppy and adorable and is so passionate about child development. But beware because the tests are SO HARD. The tests, along with the group projects killed my grade. But the research paper helped me out.","best prof i've had so far. helps students relate with funny anecdotes. assigned a project that was fun and helped make the material more comprehensible. cares about students doing well and understanding. i looked forward to going to this class every week, which was surprising as it was at 8 am. definitely sign up for any of her classes.","She was bright and sun-shiney at 8am...Attendance is pretty important. I do believe I learned most of the material from the book-READ IT!! Her tests come straight out of it, and her tests are tricky. Ultimately though, whatever she did worked! In the end i think she gives benefit of the doubt. She has students teach most of class w/presentations.","This Professor is obsoluterly awful. She does not know what she is talking about, she is biased and simply annnoying. Her test are IMPOSSIBLE","She doesn't teach to tests at all, going to class is worthless but she requires it. If you like teaching yourself, then take this course.","Her excitement in class is just a facade because she is not a nice person outside of class.  Purposely likes to make things more difficult and not at all understanding.  Told one girl that &quot;It's not the end of the world&quot; when she couldn't graduate 'cause U-S wouldn't give her a C in the class","Her tests are hard, which knocked me off at first, but she hung in there with me and helped me improve. You definitely gotta go to class - she counts attendance and tests on discussions. But she is a dynamic, smart, funny, and fun prof. No doubt. I took psych because I needed to fill a requirement, but she made me care about the material.","by far the BEST professor i've had at UNC so far.  makes class really interesting and is always excited about what she's teaching.  take this class if you have a chance but make sure you study because the class isn't a breeze.","Awesome professor -- inspiring, enthusiastic, extremely intelligent, and respectful.","Best class I've taken in Psych. She is smart, funny, and really cares about the topic and how it will affect our lives. Also spent lots of time counseling me about grad school choices.","I loved Dr. Ulku-Steiner! She was sooo enthusiastic, it was inspiring. Her class was challenging but not intimidating.","I've had her for two classes and would take ANYTHING she teaches. The most enthusiastic and caring professor I've had at Carolina. Varies presentations every day, brings in all kinds of speakers and extra materials, takes the time to get to know students out of class. Excellent prof.","Very demanding and you ABSOLUTELY must attend.","Material is very interesting and she is an awesome professor.  tests are hard and you really have to study, but its worth it. NOT an easy A, but if you are really interested there is no one better for this class","Not clear at all with instructions! Tests are tricky!"],"courses":["PSYC024","PSYC250","PSYC210","PSYC250","PSYC245","PSYCH245","PSYCH245","PSYC178","PSYC24","PSYC024","CHILDDEV","172","PSYC172","PSYCH24172","FAMASCONTEXT","PSYC144","PSYC144"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
