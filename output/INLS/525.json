Because he does not post his lecture outlines on blackboard, you spend the entire hour and 15 minutes furiously copying down tons of powerpoint slides that are essential for making good grades on tests. He was fairly disrespectful to his students and always late.","Really nice guy and extremely knowledgeable. Awesome lecturer who kept my interest most of the time. Papers are on books read, which arent too bad. Highly recommend attending class everyday to copy power points, they are your lifeline! Tons of articles to read but I only read what was necessary to complete papers and pulled off a B, not an easy A.","Professor Lee is extremely intelligent. He blazes through the material so it's a job to keep up, but it's definitely do-able. I didn't read any of the articles, but I attended every class and took extensive notes. Attendance isn't necessary, but I highly recommend it.","very difficult class, for me at least.  i don't recommend it unless you need it or have a strong fascination with African history.","This class was very reading intensive.  Hundreds of pages of reading","Brilliant and hot.","C-Lee is the man, very knowledgeable, focuses alot on South Africa (his area of expertise). Going to class isnt essential but copying the powerpoints for yourself will help study for the exams. If you're interested in African history, this class is money."],"courses":["HIST130","HIST130","HIST130","HIST130","HIST130","HIST200","HIST130"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
