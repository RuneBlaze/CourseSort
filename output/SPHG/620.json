At the end of the semester, you write a paper about a public health issue for pass/fail. Very inspirational and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a health profession!","Dr. Yeatt's taught a one-credit hour seminar course called \"Exploring Public Health\" that was amazing! Guest speakers came in and talked to us every week and it was fascinating to hear them talk about their experiences in public health. If you have an interest in public health be sure to take one of her introductory courses!","I found the class pretty easy. Dr. Yeatts is a great epidemiologist and does a good job of exposing her students to real epidemiology work through class examples and the lab assignments.","Dr. Yeatts is very kind and very intelligent. I thoroughly enjoyed her class. While lectures could seem rather redundant, the lab component of Epid 600 was very useful and interactive. Dr. Yeatts always gave prompt, clear feedback whenever I emailed with a question. I enjoyed taking this class, and would like to further my learning of Epid 600."],"courses":["SPHG620","SPHG620","EPID600","EPID600"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
