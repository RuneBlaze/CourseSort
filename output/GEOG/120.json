He is very interested in helping his students. I would recommend that you go to class since he sometimes will call on people and if you aren't there then you'll get points off. Overall the class was ok, not too much work just 5 writing assignments that weren't hard and 3 tests.","Birdsall is a very passionate and amusing professor. Although his lectures sometimes drag towards the end of class, his energy makes up for it. Show up to class, do the writing assignments, and learn the maxims and you are guaranteed at least a B+ in his class.","He's a very sweet  man and knows what he's talking about and has a great interest in his subject as well. Very adamant about everyone getting good grades. Lectures can drag on for a while and the tests cover a lot and require a lot of studying. Very interesting class overall.","Professor Birdsall is a very nice man with a passion to teach what some might think is a difficult course but with a decent amount of effort an A is completely possible. The assignments are not difficult if you don't put them off, the tests aren't that bad (they do cover a lot of material), and the material is interesting for a starter course.","Do not take this class. For an introductory class, you will be doing plenty of work that will be graded very harshly. The two tests are based on about 30-40 pages of notes, 100-200 locations, 100 concepts, and 100+ textbook pages. this class is a joke. I am an A student, and I spent hours studying for this class, only to receive a B.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I took this class thinking it would be an interesting and easy class. I could not have been more wrong.The assignments had nothing to do with the rest of the class and his tests were ridiculously hard. I went to every class, did all the assignments and ended up with a \"C\". Do not take this class unless you have to.","I didn't think this class would be difficult, but the tests seem impossible to do well on. I study very hard, but I can't seem to memorize any of the maps. There are a few papers, but some of the TAs grade harder than others. I'm pretty disappointed with the class.","Birdsall is one of the most enthusiastic professor's I've had but his lectures can get still get rather dry. GEOG 120 is a great overview course and is pretty fun and easy if you like maps and current events.","Professor Birdsall is a very knowledgeable man who seems to truly enjoy teaching.  Sometimes he can belabor a point or overcomplicate some things, but it's not hard to see what he's saying.  The class is simple if you pay attention during lectures.","It's not fair to say his class was boring because geography in general is just not that interesting.  However, unless you really love it or need the credit, don't take GEOG 120.  Birdsall is a very nice and helpful man, but it was painful to sit through each class.","One of the best professors at UNC. I have had him twice and he is a great guy who loves geography and is very helpful. He memorizes everyone's name/face so he knows if you skip class. The miniprojects can be somewhat tedious but overall the class is interesting and Birdsall is great.","a must have. his assigned readings are somewhat boring at times but he is a funny guy, extremely kind and very passionate about his subject. he assigns several mini papers that are easy to get A's on and exams are pretty easy as long as you review your notes beforehand. honestly, not much work is needed to make an A C:","Assigns worthless maxim papers and you really have to study to do well on the exams... very passionate about the subject but his lectures are off the wall","Professor Birdsall is wonderful. He is so passionate about what he teaches, and is really willing to go the extra yard to help you out. A genuinely nice man, and a great teacher. Class is very enjoyable and the workload is reasonable. Highly highly recommended.","Nice guy, really loves his job.  Have to write a lot of dumb papers but they are easy, so its not that bad.  Tests are ok, you dont have to read just take notes in class.  Basically, if you try a little bit you can get an A.","It is NOT EASY! Um hi, make good grades (3.6 GPA) so unless you can memorize every country in Africa, the capitals, rivers, languages, religions, climate, etc..then you'll be fine, but if you're like me and you hate memorizizing b/c it is elementary learning, don't take it. Birdsall is entertaining though. P.S. I have a B+ in the class.","Nice guy, decent professor.  He can be a bit boring at times, but he truly cares about his job.  He does, however, assign these worthless maxim papers that are total bs.  His exams aren't too difficult, but some questions can trip you up.  Nice guy though.","this was the first time the class was ever given so it was rocky and probably still will be for 06-07 year. he's very sweet and a bit of a pushover, kids took advantage of him. he'll work with you and is helpful. he's really into geog. & memorials & can go on about it. field trip to d.c. to look at memorials. presentations 2nd half of sememster!","funny enthusiastic man.  tests are not too bad.  Lectures are ohk.","Very willing to answer questions.  Assignments are appropriate for the class."],"courses":["GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG260","GEOG125","GEOG120","GEOG260","GEOG125","GEOG125","GEOG120","GEOG6E","GEOG20","GEOG20"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":120,"section":990,"class_nbr":11765,"title":"WORLD REGIONAL GEOG","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
