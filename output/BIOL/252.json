Truly cares about his students. If you do the work and don't get behind on the readings, it's easy to do well. Also, his lectures are hilariousssss! and when I came a few minutes late to an exam one day and there were no more seats, he let me sit in the front so I'll have a desk. You can tell he truly cares about his students.","Fantastic lecturer. Anatomy is a lot of dense material but he explains it clearly. Also, Johnson records his lectures which is clutch af when studying. Be sure to get the poll everywhere question right! Correct answers give an extra bonus point. The tests are tough but they are completely fair and straight forward. TAKE HIM","Challenging class.  Soooooo much material, but you'll thank him later. Really great lectures.  There's some of the talk-to-your-neighbor BS like other bio classes but not too much.  This course helped me learn to READ, and I'm thankful for it.","Good lecturer","I would recommend him to anyone who is taking Anatomy and Physiology. It is definitely not a class you can easily pass by studying the day before. His exams are difficult but fair. Most of the exam questions are straight forward and some are tricky. Lab is a hard, so be careful and study a lot. He's such a cute and nice person.","Great lecturer.  The bio dept. needs more like him.  Tests were tricky, but very fair.  Purchase the bigger textbook.  The condensed one does not cover some of his lecture material.  That way, if you miss something from lecture, you can get it from the book.  Super approachable and caring; never felt rushed out the door in office hours.","Class uses both textbook and his lectures. There is a ton of information to learn but he does his best to make it fair albeit difficult. The first test was the easiest so don't slack especially on tests 2 and 3. He is engaging and committed to the class.","A pretty clear lecturer but boring. He's monotone and will throw around some jokes, but I honestly couldn't pay attention in class. Watch out cause his tests are tricky. Sometimes he takes more questions from the book info and sometimes more from his lectures/ppts. Nice guy and if you argue back for test points, he'll most likely give you one.","Awesome professor. As he says \"Just know everything and you will be fine\". Biol 252 is a had class, but if I would have to take it all over again, I would take it with him. I would take any possible class with him, loved him. He is a great teacher!","Professor Johnson is the best professor I have ever had. Take any and all courses you can with him. Heck, if he was teaching Intro to Women's Studies or History of Medieval Europe I would take that class. The subject matter is difficult for A&P, but he makes it interesting. The assignments are easy. The multiple-choice exams are not. Study a lot.","ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFESSORS! Anatomy and Physiology is a lot of work! but his powerpoints are great! He always seems to cover everything you need to know without rushing. you have to do your part (study his ppts), but you can't claim your failure on him.","Love Dr. Johnson (so cute), but this class is hard. My advice - write down every single thing he says in class and study like crazy. Tests are fair but hard. He is great with email so def email him with questions (I did all the time). Lab is a pain b/c he writes the exams now, not the TAs, so lab is not as easy. Book is not really needed.","GREAT TEACHER!  Take him for A&P if you have the opportunity!!","I love Dr. Johnson! Probably the best professor I had at UNC.","By far the best professor I've had. Tells you exactly what will be on the exam (what's on the outlines). The book he chose is very good. Only tests you on material you go over in class although you need to know more details on those topics. Also very nice person who will be glad to help you with any problems.","Dr. Johnson is a sweet man & a good professor. He e-mails back very fast & is willing to meet with you/hold exam study sessions. BIOL in general is hard but straightforward so if you don't do well it's not his fault. His tests are completely reasonable & he makes little jokes in class. He also sometimes mentions his new daughter which is adorable.","Dr. Johnson is the best! He is readily available for office hours and his lecture notes are clear and concise. While I recommend that you read the textbook (it's helpful), you don't have to, since he only tests things that he covered in class. Plus, he is incredibly cute and fun to listen to!","I love Dr. Johnson!! :) Amazing professor. The class was at 8am but definitely worth coming to. Exams weren't too bad pretty straight forward but theres a ****ton of material, but thats for any class. Would definitely take him again for other bio classes.","Very nice guy. Extremely helpful and cares a lot about his student. Not an easy class...lots of memorizations but you bust you butt and you'll do well ;) Plus he gives you a chance to make up for you lowest grade if you improve well enough.","Great Professor. Unlike most bio profs he cares about his students. Funny, helpful, and makes class enjoyable. Outline notes are posted before lecture, which helps when the lecture material gets dull. Tests are fill in the blank & T/F, but he makes it clear what will and will not be on the test."],"courses":["BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","ANAT252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL276","BIOL252","BIOL276"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":252,"section":3,"class_nbr":3147,"title":"FUNDAMENTALS OF HUMAN A&P","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Genome Sciences BuiRloom","room":"MWF","days":"09","time":null,"instructor":"SHEMER,GIDEON","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["PX"],"enrl_cap":100,"enrl_tot":141,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1379920","fname":"Gideon","lname":"Shemer","quality":"4.4","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"Skip class?

I remember many people saying that this was the professor that they had ever had, and now, I think the same thing. However, don't underestimate the work load. Anatomy in general is tough, but you are still expected to know just as much as any other course.","Great lecturer, who knows his stuff. If you're fascinated by the human body, this class will give you the satisfaction of deeply exploring its marvels. I must say that since 92% of your overall grade is test average, the pressure to perform is always there... which amounts to many hours of studying notes and textbook material.","Dr. Shemer is a genius and makes class really interesting. The tests are fair for what is covered in lecture, but sometimes the multiple choice is tricky","Great teacher! Shemer is very knowledgeable about biology and answers any questions you have really well or to the best of his ability. He assigns just the few pages of reading that you need and goes over topics in detail during class so everything that will be on the test will be explained in person. Take lots of notes during lecture.","Dr. Shemer is the best professor I've encountered in the biology department. His lectures are clear and well organized, he's interactive with the class, and takes questions often and seems to really care if we understand the material.  He gives a lot of practice for the tests and his review sessions are super helpful.","Shemer is one of the most intelligent lecturers I have ever had. He makes attending lecture interesting and worth my while. There is a TON of material, but that is with the nature of the class. He also only has two exams, and then the final, so there is more pressure on those two classes. You really cannot find a better professor for the material.","The class is hard, but very fair. Shemer is a great teacher and gives lots of resources for extra help. If you study the material along the way and don't wait until the weekend before the test, you'll be fine. Lab is worth a big part of your grade, so study hard for that too and you'll be fine","Great professor. Very funny, loves what he teaches, crystal clear. His exams are not bad, makes you think and apply your knowledge, if you study his notes and understand the material well, you'll be fine","Passionate, interesting, knowledgeable, and humorous.  His exam are fair but challenging.  I highly recommend him for A&P.","He is fabulous. hard and expects a lot from his students but truly one of the best at UNC. He is a must!","Shemer is passionate about what he teaches and truly tries to integrate the entire class in his lectures. But his tests are very unfair. I studied for weeks before and still did badly on them. He even said in class \"I know that some of you are studying a lot and still doing bad. Don't be discouraged.\" Great, but my Gpa is messed up bc of this! :/","He is very funny and a nice guy! His lectures are interesting, but his tests are the hardest tests I have ever taken. I would put in over 20 hours studying and just do decent on the test. Also you HAVE to go to class. He tests you on stuff that he just says in class and is not in the book or on powerpoints.","Very difficult class, especially for someone who is not interested in science. However, I absolutely loved this class. I enjoyed going every day. His tests are very hard, but he's also clear on what to expect. Study hard and often, and enjoy his funny lectures!","Anatomy with Shemer was one of my favorite classes at UNC. It was entertaining, interesting, & funny & he was always available in office hours. Exams were challenging but it was clear what to expect; they were multiple choice, t/f, & fill-in-the-blank, requiring higher-level thinking. He scheduled exams so they wouldn?t conflict with lab exams.","An all around good fellow. He has high expectations not for the purpose of maintaining a curve, but because he is genuinely concerned if you do well.","He is INCREDIBLE!  He is so interested in the subject matter and he brings a lot of energy to the class, so lectures are a lot of fun.  He talks quickly, so I would recommend a recorder.  He also offers extra credit for a few people if they want to write a song about anatomy and perform it!  He is always willing to give additional explanations.","Prof. Shemer is one of the best professors I've ever had.  Although the course isn't easy due to the breath of material covered, Shemer is very clear in explaining what you need to know.  He's entertaining, keeps the class engaged and his powerpoints are very helpful.  Definitely recommend this class! (but must you must study regularly to do well).","This class is pretty hard but he is definitely a great teacher. He really cares that you learn the material. Just make sure you the information like the back of your hand. Would definitely suggest this class.","Awesome teacher! Difficult material, but what else would you expect with the human body. His speech is hard to understand at times but he does all he can to help you out. Overall this was one of my favorite classes at UNC.","Loved him!  No curve though.  Class is really fun, and he's hilarious.  Make sure you go to class and read.

Tests are fill in the blank & T/F, but he makes it clear what will and will not be on the test."],"courses":["BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","ANAT252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL276","BIOL252","BIOL276"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":252,"section":4,"class_nbr":3149,"title":"FUNDAMENTALS OF HUMAN A&P","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Genome Sciences BuiRloom","room":"MWF","days":"09","time":null,"instructor":"SHEMER,GIDEON","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["PX"],"enrl_cap":50,"enrl_tot":78,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1379920","fname":"Gideon","lname":"Shemer","quality":"4.4","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"Skip class?

I remember many people saying that this was the professor that they had ever had, and now, I think the same thing. However, don't underestimate the work load. Anatomy in general is tough, but you are still expected to know just as much as any other course.","Great lecturer, who knows his stuff. If you're fascinated by the human body, this class will give you the satisfaction of deeply exploring its marvels. I must say that since 92% of your overall grade is test average, the pressure to perform is always there... which amounts to many hours of studying notes and textbook material.","Dr. Shemer is a genius and makes class really interesting. The tests are fair for what is covered in lecture, but sometimes the multiple choice is tricky","Great teacher! Shemer is very knowledgeable about biology and answers any questions you have really well or to the best of his ability. He assigns just the few pages of reading that you need and goes over topics in detail during class so everything that will be on the test will be explained in person. Take lots of notes during lecture.","Dr. Shemer is the best professor I've encountered in the biology department. His lectures are clear and well organized, he's interactive with the class, and takes questions often and seems to really care if we understand the material.  He gives a lot of practice for the tests and his review sessions are super helpful.","Shemer is one of the most intelligent lecturers I have ever had. He makes attending lecture interesting and worth my while. There is a TON of material, but that is with the nature of the class. He also only has two exams, and then the final, so there is more pressure on those two classes. You really cannot find a better professor for the material.","The class is hard, but very fair. Shemer is a great teacher and gives lots of resources for extra help. If you study the material along the way and don't wait until the weekend before the test, you'll be fine. Lab is worth a big part of your grade, so study hard for that too and you'll be fine","Great professor. Very funny, loves what he teaches, crystal clear. His exams are not bad, makes you think and apply your knowledge, if you study his notes and understand the material well, you'll be fine","Passionate, interesting, knowledgeable, and humorous.  His exam are fair but challenging.  I highly recommend him for A&P.","He is fabulous. hard and expects a lot from his students but truly one of the best at UNC. He is a must!","Shemer is passionate about what he teaches and truly tries to integrate the entire class in his lectures. But his tests are very unfair. I studied for weeks before and still did badly on them. He even said in class \"I know that some of you are studying a lot and still doing bad. Don't be discouraged.\" Great, but my Gpa is messed up bc of this! :/","He is very funny and a nice guy! His lectures are interesting, but his tests are the hardest tests I have ever taken. I would put in over 20 hours studying and just do decent on the test. Also you HAVE to go to class. He tests you on stuff that he just says in class and is not in the book or on powerpoints.","Very difficult class, especially for someone who is not interested in science. However, I absolutely loved this class. I enjoyed going every day. His tests are very hard, but he's also clear on what to expect. Study hard and often, and enjoy his funny lectures!","Anatomy with Shemer was one of my favorite classes at UNC. It was entertaining, interesting, & funny & he was always available in office hours. Exams were challenging but it was clear what to expect; they were multiple choice, t/f, & fill-in-the-blank, requiring higher-level thinking. He scheduled exams so they wouldn?t conflict with lab exams.","An all around good fellow. He has high expectations not for the purpose of maintaining a curve, but because he is genuinely concerned if you do well.","He is INCREDIBLE!  He is so interested in the subject matter and he brings a lot of energy to the class, so lectures are a lot of fun.  He talks quickly, so I would recommend a recorder.  He also offers extra credit for a few people if they want to write a song about anatomy and perform it!  He is always willing to give additional explanations.","Prof. Shemer is one of the best professors I've ever had.  Although the course isn't easy due to the breath of material covered, Shemer is very clear in explaining what you need to know.  He's entertaining, keeps the class engaged and his powerpoints are very helpful.  Definitely recommend this class! (but must you must study regularly to do well).","This class is pretty hard but he is definitely a great teacher. He really cares that you learn the material. Just make sure you the information like the back of your hand. Would definitely suggest this class.","Awesome teacher! Difficult material, but what else would you expect with the human body. His speech is hard to understand at times but he does all he can to help you out. Overall this was one of my favorite classes at UNC.","Loved him!  No curve though.  Class is really fun, and he's hilarious.  Make sure you go to class and read.  This was my favorite class at Chapel Hill."],"courses":["BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL202","BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL202","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":252,"section":951,"class_nbr":12832,"title":"FUNDAMENTALS OF HUMAN A&P","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Genome Sciences BuiR","room":"1374","days":"MW","time":"18","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["PX"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
