How harsh the grading is depends on your TA and I learned that all too well this year.  But I didn't read hardly anything or put any effort into the entire year and received a B+ so it is by no means difficult.","Extremely informative. The 14 journals required are easy A's. Essay's not too bad. Ernst is ridiculously knowledgable. He has a blunt turn of phrase that's jarring at first, but it grows on you, and the class's atmosphere is very laid-back and open to debate. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good overview of Islam.","Ernst is very knowledgeable about this subject. He even wrote one of the books required for the class. He is interested in student's views. However the class was very boring. Only those seriously interested in the subject will probably enjoy it.","He knows everything, but he's pretty boring and kind of an ass in person. The grading is really easy, it's all in two papers, 14 page-long journals and two quizzes. You can skip class and you'll be fine. The reading materials were really interesting to me, and so was recitation, so do those if you're interested in the subject matter.","Incredibly knowledgeable. Very calm and straightforward in lectures, which some could interpret as boring. I enjoyed his humble, quiet sense of humor. You will learn a TON about Islam and early Islamic civilization. Workload was flexible, although it seemed difficult to get more than a B+.","He rambles and spends a good part of every class letting random students talk about whatever they think is interesting. It feels like he skips over anything relevant. You have to write 14 journals, which are easy and you can do without reading but it's annoying. LOTS of reading. Two quizzes (study guides provided). Papers for exams.","Professor Ernst is a brilliant person and his lectures are used to highlight broad concepts. You do have to do the reading though; I got a lot more out of the class when I did it. And there are only a few assignments! If you want reliable background information on Islam, this is the course to take but you do have to have to have interest in it.","I really enjoyed this course. Ernst is one of the most knowledgeable professors i've had. There is a good bit of reading, but they're not terribly boring (I loved Following Muhammad). Like most classes you'll get out what you put in. If you never read or take notes and expect him to essentially write your paper in lecture, i'd skip this one.","I thought Intro to Islamic Civilization was an introductory course.  No.  Half the class dropped it or stopped attending lectures.  DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN ISLAMIC EDUCATION; If you do, you'll like his semi-discussion formatted lectures, and (only) 3 assignments (Weekly journals on reading; midterm and final paper).","The worst class I have ever taken!  It was so boring, and he rambled all class long.  He always took questions in lecture, which is usually good, but he was just so boring and rambled so much his answers never made sense.  Excessive reading assignments.  My TA was awful, too, and we had barely any assignments to boost (or earn) grades.","I'm blown away by this man.","i dropped this class because he was extremely boring and had no stucture. lectures were full of him talking very little about the subject and showing pictures from vacation in religious places. when it came time to write papers he expected us to pull things out of thin air since he didnt really teach. you have to teach yourself. 1 TA was mean!","No Comments","Professor Ernst is one of the most interesting and knowledgable people I've ever had the joy of learning from.  He had incredible insights and we had a lot of fun in this class.  The class was small, and we intensively studied Iranian and Islamic culture.  We did a review of travel guides from the 17th century on at his house that was lots of fun!","If you want an honest opinion about Islam or Muslims this is your class. Ernsts book Following Muhammad would recommend to anyone. He teaches this class like a grad level course and the learning is on you. I thought the TA's graded the papers fairly and I scored poorly on one. Just put in the time.","Ernst is incredibly boring and his lectures are very unorganized. I couldn't really tell what the concepts were that he was trying to emphasize. The 4 essays we wrote, which are practically the only grades, were graded way too strictly. I don't know too much more now that I did before about Islam.","Awful. You must love Islamic history to enjoy this. Don't bother reading because he summarizes in class. Essay for midterm and final. Graded harder than english papers, which is insane because we know nothing about Islam (why else are we taking this class&#63;). Captain Boring. Could be a lot better!"],"courses":["RELI180","RELI64","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI180","RELI581","RELI180","RELI","RELI173","RELI25","RELI25","RELI25"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
