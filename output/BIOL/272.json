Could not pay attention in lectures, no matter how hard I tried, and the book and powerpoints are useless, making it impossible to study for the exams. Other stuff is easier, however, and I got a B while doing literally no work whatsoever.","Weakley is definitely knowledgeable and willing to help you out if you are struggling, but don't take this class expecting an easy A. There is a lot of memorization involved. If you put in the time though, you should get a good grade!","Very memorization heavy class. People tend to really like Weakley or really dislike. I liked him! He's a cool guy and lectures are pretty interesting. Not too much problem solving in a class like Local Flora, but tons of flashcards.","I LOVED this class, by far my favorite biology professor at UNC. He is so nice and really wants to get to know his students. He's also always willing to help. It's a lot of memorizing sometimes, but his tests aren't like those other bio classes that applies confusing concepts to some really hard problem. A class worth taking!","Best professor I have had at UNC. Extremely helpful, friendly, and intelligent man. Dr. Weakley is an amazing professor and his class is so much fun. He realizes that students don't care about their classes, so the class is entirely structured around how much each student puts into it. If you don't study, you won't do well, simple as that."],"courses":["BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
