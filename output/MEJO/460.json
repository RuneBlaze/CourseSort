Made me LOVE journalism. Tough/hard class but SO worth it. One of my favorite classes at UNC so far.","Ryan is amazing. At first he seems intimidating, but he knows his stuff. He grades fair, is extremely helpful, and really CARES about his students. Be careful and work hard in his class, however, because he will expect a lot from you. His class is definitely worth it.","No Comments","If you are in the J school and have to take News Writing then I highly recommend Thornburg. He expects a lot from his students but expects even more from himself. Very helpful and one the hardest working professors in the biz."],"courses":["JOMC153","JOMC153","JOMC491","JOMC153"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
