She is more than willing to meet with you one-on-one and help you understand all material fully. All of the material is explained fully in class though so as long as you pay attention, it is relatively easy to understand. Take all notes in class and go to class and you will do well.","Came into this class as a student that struggled in math and this class was no different. She's a tough grader and wants things done in a specific way and will take off points. Class is mostly examples that don't really apply to the tests and the homework is a lot easier than the test questions. Final was different than review and weird wording.","The class is fairly easy but she is a VERY tough grader.
