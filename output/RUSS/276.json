Lapushin is the bomb. Super easy grader and fantastic, interesting lectures. If you ever get the chance to take a class with him DO IT. One of the best professors at UNC.","Hands-down, one of the best professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I took one class with him my third semester at Carolina and took another my fourth and fifth semesters here! He inspired me to change my major to Russian and Slavic Language and Culture and has been there to guide me every step of the way! Take a class with him!","I had Lapushin for a first year seminar, Madness and (Russian) Lit. Class is almost entirely discussion-based with only a little bit of highly informal lecture. By the end of the semester I was wishing he would lecture more because he is SO GOOD at it--he is engaging and inspiring. Also, he's very easy at least in a FYS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","Really passionate about the subject. Helpful, enthusiastic, and engaging. Take his class!","Awesome prof - dedicated, enthusiastic, very russian :) class was a joy","The best professor at UNC.","So enthusiastic and entertaining! Lots of reading, but he never gives reading quizzes. Not the easiest paper grader, but not too difficult and he offers help","Professor Lapushin is the hidden jem of UNC. He is the best professor I've ever had. His passion and excitement for what he teaches makes every class worth attending just so you can hear him talk. Sometimes he'll act out scenes from what we're reading and drop to his knees. He is super nice and really wants his students to do well. Take his classes","Read the other reviews. Lapushin is the best professor at UNC, bar none. He sometimes has a habit of talking over students, but only because he gets so excited over books. He's like one of those professors from movies that ends up changing your perspective on the world. Take a class with this man before you graduate. And UNC: tenure this man!","Easily one of the best professors I have had at UNC.  I'm a math major, but after taking a russian literature class from Professor Lapushin, I have a genuine interest in the subject.  Lapushin makes virtually every reading fascinating.  He is also an incredibly nice and helpful person.","Great professor.  His passion for books and reading is infectious.  He helps you to see and understand literature in completely new ways.  He's also genuinely a nice person and concerned with every student's performance in the class.  Take him!","The best professor I've ever had.","Simply put, he is the man.","Absolutely phenomenal professor.  I don't care what your major is, don't leave Carolina without taking a course with this man.  He is brilliant, helpful, and extremely funny.  Russian literature comes to life when he's at the helm.  In fact, just let Lapushin teach everything.","I LOVE THIS MAN! he is funny, very passionate, and really makes us get down to the bottom of the question during class discussions. always pushes us to understand the text better. there are only two papers and two exams, the rest is reading and discussion. oh, and prepare for the best Russian accent you will ever hear.","One of the funniest and intelligent professors ever.  He truly knows exactly what he's talking about and is ALWAYS available to help out if you feel you need it at all.  He's got great passion for Russian Literature and will truly help you enjoy the subject matter!!","No Comments"],"courses":["RUSS465","RUSS450","SLAV86","465","RUSS465","RUSS81","SLAV86","RUSS442","RUSS432","RUSS140","RUSS270","RUSS281","RUSS281","RUSS281","RUSS270","RUSS270","RUSS270"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
