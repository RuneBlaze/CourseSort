My third class with Sweet.  Not easy, but worth it!","This was a great class.  I learned a lotand ended the semester much better at critical analysis and writing.  Will take other classes with this professor.","I think a lot of us didnt know what this class would be like, but it was a lot of fun and I learned a lot.  Definitely recommend.","I didnt know what to expect from this classI didnt even know what cultural landscape meant.  But it was fun.  Lots of field trips.  Most projects we could do in small groups, or not, and that worked out great.  Great introduction to Chapel Hill.","Great class, great professor.  I would definitely take other classes with him.","This is not an easy course, but it was fascinating and changed the way I think.  Great experience.","Sweet is a great guy if you get to know him. He's a hard grader and we have projects biweekly and readings with questions every class, but the class itself is very enjoyable with the sites and interesting projects. You are able to work in groups with projects which helped a lot and he brings snacks sometimes since the class is 3 hrs long!","The projects for this class were actually really fun and interesting to do. Since this class fulfills an EE credit, we would often venture to different locations around the campus, the town of Chapel Hill, and to Durham to do fieldwork and to visually experience what we would read about for assignments. It was a cool class was taught well by him!","If the subject material for the class had not been as interesting as it was I would have dropped in the first week (and a lot of people did). Honestly the sheer amount of work you have to put in on a weekly basis is insane. He though nothing of assigning AN ENTIRE NOVEL at the end of class on Tuesday and expected it to be read by class on Thursday!","Save yourself and don't take this class or any other class with him. It is very evident that he is out to get his students and has a serious disdain for them. His paper assignments are incredibly ambiguous; and no matter how hard you work on them, he will not give you the grade you deserve .  He is downright mean to his classes.","Absolutely terrible teacher. I went to every lecture and it was miserable, this class has been the bane of my existence this semester. Hands down the biggest workload, 40+ page readings twice a week and two 6+ page papers. John Sweet fails to understand that you take other classes, and will make even those who like history to start hating it.","Worst class I've ever had. Professor Sweet assigns entirely too much reading and assignments to the point that I am failing 2 other classes because I have to put so much time into this one class. Lecture feels more like an interrogation and makes for a very uncomfortable learning environment. Gives smart alike attitude like he is talking down to us","Not a good professor. Spends way too much time getting off topic and doesn't help students when they need it. Assigns 40 pages of monotonous reading every other night which will make you less interested in history as a whole. Lectures are easy to zone out in and he assumes a passive aggressive attitude when participation is lower than expected.","Absolutely the worst class I've ever taken. Prof. Sweet's lectures are long and confusing. Very easy to zone out. The guidelines for papers are incredibly vague and unclear so you have no idea if you're on the right track or not. Not interested in going the extra mile to help students. Definitely going to try to avoid him in the future.","Really engaging professor. Lots of papers and reading, but as long as you keep and you're prepared, you'll do fine. The subject matter and professor were interesting enough to help me stay on top of things. One of the best professors I've had.","His classes are not easy but if you want to get better at writing & research he's your best choice.  You get what you put in if you show effort he will push you to get better.  Overall he knows the subject & offers excellent feedback on your writing.  He also has a good sense of humor and knows how to keep your attention.","Great Professor knows his subject, class was fun but not easy.","He assigned alot of reading, but was good at explaining what he wanted you to get out of it in class. Few assignments, but he graded essays way too hard for it to be a freshman seminar. He was unclear as to improving the essays and when you asked for help, he only told you what HE would do."],"courses":["HIST566","HIST278","HIST70","HIST70","HIST278","HIST566","HIST70","HIST070","HIST566","HIST278","HIST278","HIST278","HIST278","HIST278","HIST566","HIST566","HIST566","HIST006IDREAM"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
