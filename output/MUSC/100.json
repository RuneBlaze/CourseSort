Great teacher. Really wants to see all her students succeed. She is very accommodating of students and, as long as you let her know ahead of time, you can miss class occasionally. Her lectures were clear and captivating. All in all, a great teacher, passionate about the subject material.","Dr. Yang is one of the best pianists and professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She always finds ways to improve your skills as a musician and is there to help you achieve any musical feat you desire. I have seen so much progress  and development in myself as an individual since taking lessons with her."],"courses":["MUSC223","MUSC200"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MUSC","catalog_nbr":100,"section":1,"class_nbr":1390,"title":"INDIV KEYBOARD LESSONS","component":"Lecture","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"OTTEN,THOMAS J","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1195146","fname":"Thomas","lname":"Otten","quality":"5.0","easiness":"5.0","help":"5.0","clarity":"5.0","topTag":"Participation matters (2)","grade":"5.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Dr. Otten is incredibly helpful and specific in his feedback.
