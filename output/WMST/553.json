Very intriguing & helpful. Grading was fair & she was always available to talk after class.","She was extremely interested in the subject matter and an excellent speaker, and her tests were relatively easy. She was always available to talk about Women's Studies. I definitely recommend this class!","Dr. Berger was an excellent professor and her lectures were very interesting.  However, if you are looking for an easy class to fill credits this is not it.  The class was pretty difficult with a lot of reading, but the subject matter was fantastic.  I learned at lot from this class and would recommend it to all those whom are interested.","I really enjoyed her lecture classes, even though she tended to turn down the lights and make the whole class drowsy. She's an excellent speaker, always puts her (half completed) slides online, and is aways willing to talk. The recitation sections really made the class awesome.","I loved her!!!","This was the first women's studies class I took at UNC, and afterwards, I became a women's studies major.  I agree that class can sometimes be dull, but overall it is an engaging subject matter and she was an excellent professor.  Lots of reading, but very relevant.  The tests were hard, so study!  Amazing class and great professor.","Excellent professor. Engaging and insightful. This class changed my life!","This Professor was awesome. The readings she assigned were interesting and make you want 2 read more. They were very engaging. The assignments were not hard but interesting and somewhat fun to do. Also I loved the assigned movies we had to watch, not to mention the discussions in class were very engaging too. The class overall was wonderful!","This class definately exceeded my expectations and Professor Berger is definatley very intelligent and passionate about the subject. Tests were very hard and there is alot of reading.","I loved this class and she is an excellent professor.  As long as you read the material, which is interesting, and attend lectures this is an easy class.  She is very specific about what is going to be on the tests which makes them easier; the quizes however can be extremely hard.  She has a fair grading system and an intereactive lecture.","i wasnt at all interested in the subject matter, but she made it as interesting as it could be. uses a variety of methods to enhance learning, like film clips, songs, and websites, which makes it very interesting. public lectures were annoying. tests were very specific,so they were difficult to study for","She is extremely smart and interesting. Sometimes lectures can be boring, but it's because of subject matter, not teacher. She's not at all lenient on grades or work. Lots of work but a great class.","Very engaging and interesting reading. Uses multimedia very well and keeps students interested. I always look forward to her class and I always leave thinking about what we've just talked about. I think this is a life-changing class. Recommended for both men and women.","Lectures are very broad while exams are very specific, has a habit of treating gigantic lectures as if they are a small discussion group.  Interesting subject matter, but tries too hard to vary the class format, so we end up doing things that can only be effective in smaller groups.  For example, asking questions of the students...student responses can rarely be heard by classmates.  Also, has double standard on allowing student announcements -- allowed a Sports Illustrated announcement, but not UNC Choice.","Dr. Berger is an amazingly smart woman and she definitely makes an effort to make her classes interesting (like showing a film clip at the end of every lecture)","No Comments","No Comments","No Comments"],"courses":["WMST51","WMST101","WMST101","WMST101","WMST101","WMST50","WMST087","WMST051","WMST50","WMST050","WMST50","WMST50","WMST50","WMST50","WMST050","WMST50","WMST158","WMST50"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
