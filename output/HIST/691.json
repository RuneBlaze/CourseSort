Stick to the readings as lecture progresses and his lectures make more sense. My favorite thing he says when class is finished is, \"and that is the scene for today\" and it really does feel kind of like story time, but way cooler. Great class.","Amazing lecture.  You must read all books, if you want to pass test. Also he is very serious about plagiarism. the work he checked by plagramme  plagiarism checker.","Dr. Whalen is a great professor. He really knows his stuff and is very excited to be teaching it. He structures the class so it does not burden you too much. However, the assignments do not have clear grading criteria. Overall, a great class though and I would definitely recommend.","Dr. Whalen is a very passionate professor who is always enthusiastic about teaching his class. Although his focus (at least for Medieval History) was mainly on the Church (an important part of Medieval History) and not much at all on castles and knights (what most people take Medieval History hoping to learn about), he keeps class upbeat and fun.","Professor Whalen did a great job.  He's energetic, articulate and always gives a thoughtful and well prepared lecture.  He gets the billing as the cutest professor in Christendom!","He takes attendance every single despite it being a lecture class but it is worth going to class everyday. He seems like he will be tough at first but he is super animated with lecture and uses all kinds of guides and tools to make the lectures super interesting. Definitely a class worth taking even if you don't like history.","Loved the class, the documentary he showed that he was in was awesome!","I took this class just to get rid of a Gen Ed, yet I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, all because of Whalen. Medieval History is not an easy subject and the class requires that you take notes, study, and read A LOT, but Whalen is the most inspiring teacher I have had.  His passion and his genuine desire to see students succeed is incredible!","Brett really cares about Medieval History! His passion for his subject is the strongest of any professor I have encountered at UNC.  Attendance in recitation AND lecture is mandatory and taken daily. Everything is graded by TAs, so subjectivity often arises. It is a tough class but not impossible! It satisfies great general education requirements.","Dr. Whalen taught my undergraduate research seminar for my history degree and I would not have wanted anyone else. He's funny, engaging and super helpful. He genuinely wants to see his students succeed and gets so excited when you're doing well. Incredibly smart- he knows what he's talking about. One of Carolina's best. Take him if you can!","Professor Whalen is one of the best professors that I've had at UNC.  His passion for the medieval period is contagious (and I hated history going into the class).  He makes boring subject matter extremely funengaging, but you do have to work for your grade.  There is a lot of reading and lots of participation is expected.","I had Whalen for an honors course on medieval apocalyptic thought, his specialty. The readings were  dry but he makes up for it in lectures--he's engaging, funny, and brilliant. He grades fairly (not harshly)--your grade equates to how much effort you put in. He values student discussion and input. Overall, an amazing prof-take a class with him!","GREATEST. Professor Whalen is extremely excited about medieval history, and wants you to be as well. You must go to class and be typing notes nonstop, but his lectures are very interesting. Tests and papers are very straightforward, and a lot of your grade is participation. Hate history, but one of the top 3 classes I've had at Carolina!","Dr. Whalen is awesome!!! Funny, kind, fascinating lecturer, very helpful and accessible. Lots of reading, but reasonable amount of writing. Not an easy class, but definitely worth it. I hate history but I loved this class!","Great lecturer, but acts like you don't have any other classes to worry about. At least an hour of reading to do for every class period. Essays due way too often. Not to mention having an essay due on Friday and then a test the following Monday. Like I said, great lecturer, but way too much work for an intro level class.","Great professor, if you have the chance, take his class. Super helpful.","Absolute best professor. He's very concerned with his students understanding the material, he's a fascinating lecturer, and he's very clear about what he wants.","Prof. Whalen is one of the most interesting professors I have had at UNC. He is passionate about Medieval History and is fun to listen to. His lectures are always engaging, he is always cheerful and so excited about lecture you can't help but enjoy the class. The class is not the easiest but if you hit the books you should be fine.","Prof. Whalen is great, his class is always really interesting and fun to go to. If you have a chance to take his class, DO IT. As far as history classes go, this one is definitely one of the best Ive ever had.","Professor Whalen is an outstanding teacher, plain and simple. He has passion for the subject and presents information with perfect clarity. It's nearly impossible not to become enthralled and interested in his class.  Highly recommend.  I can't wait to take another of his classes!"],"courses":["HIST107","HIST177H","HIST107","HIST107","HISTORY107","107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST398","177H","HIST177H","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
