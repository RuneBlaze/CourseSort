I've taken 3 classes with her and have loved every single one.  She is a SUPER fair grader, gives helpful and encouraging feedback, doesn't like tests, gives great lectures, and facilitates discussion well.  Prioritizes student learning, not too much reading, and is organized.  Probably my favorite prof so far at UNC.","Professor Burrill is a wonderful Women's Studies professor, and is obviously very passionate about anything she is teaching. She grades based on the thought and effort put into your work, and appreciates someone who will participate in class and contribute to intellectual discussion. She has been one of my favorite professors at UNC.","Your grade really depends on your TA. 50% of your grade is from the recitation. The rest of your grade relies on your midterm and final. If she makes the test, then they're really detailed and based on the readings. If the TAs make the test, then they're more on the overall concept.","You could probably get away with not getting the textbook, because everything she assigns is available online through Google for free.  Her quizzes are made by the TAs, so they have combinations of easy and crazy-hard questions.","Lecture is very interesting, and the readings are as well. She really makes you think about different perspectives and does so in a very interesting and easy way. A must take course!"],"courses":["WMST202","WMST202","WMST101","WMST101","WMST101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
