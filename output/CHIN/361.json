She shares many fun stories (appropriate to lecture of course) and classes were always entertaining.","While it may be difficult (at times) to understand her, she is very sweet and has everything on a PowerPoint. I didn't pay attention much in this class, I skipped the show & tell part, and did not keep up with the readings, but I managed to pull out a B+. I definitely recommend this class to anyone trying to get through Gen Eds.","Professor Hsiao is  the best professor I have ever had in my life. She always encourages students to think and she also has numerous inspiring ideas.","Attendance is MANDATORY. Every class. You can't miss a single class or she will take points off. Also, participation is a must. The class itself was pretty easy. Only three tests. But the tests are take home and you can use any resources to help. But her questions are pretty specific, so google wasn't really a big help. The lectures were the worst.","Lectures can be pretty boring sometimes. Her English is okay, but sometimes unclear. However, the class was pretty easy, and she is sometimes funny. She doesn't grade that hard. For this class, make you know how to analyze illustrations. This is a skill she didn't teach and sort of assumed you already knew.","Professor Hsiao is an amazing person, and knew her subject matter better than anyone else. The only reason I was not totally into it, was because I am not all about chinese or theater, but she is amazing. It was also a pretty easy class with just a couple papers and a very easy final exam.","Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject. Tests have two essays each and about 50 multiple choice questions. They are take-home and open-book, but there is so much material that they can still be difficult. Hsiao laoshi is not a native English speaker, which can cause clarity problems for some students. You must read and participate.","The class is pretty demanding, there are lots of quizzes and a lot of text is covered. Professor Hsiao is very helpful and lenient on grading. I learned a lot from this class. Attendance is mandatory!","She is very nice and really wants you to study hard and advance as far as possible in the language.  Her class and syllabus are very structured and very demanding, there are quizes and assignments to do for absolutely every class.  But, if you just come to class and do everything, she is not a hard grader, i would even say she is very lenient."],"courses":["CHIN552","CHIN150","CHIN361","CHIN150","CHIN452","CHIN361","CHIN150","CHIN313","CHIN305"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
