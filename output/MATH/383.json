Amazing lectures. I learned so much. Math 521 is hard, but take it with Jason. It won't be easy, but it will be so rewarding, and you will not regret it. He is a wonderful person and cares so much about his students. He always goes above and beyond. Absolutely exceptional.","THE BEST professor I have ever had. Jason Metcalfe is both an amazing mathematician and an amazing professor. His class was not easy, but it was so rewarding. If Jason Metcalfe is teaching a course- take it. Regardless of what it is. I would take any course with him, even if I didn't need it for my major. He is awesome!!!","I can't recommend Jason highly enough. He by far the best math professor I've had at UNC. His class is hard but worth it especially if you are considering math grad school. His number one priority is making sure his students learn. He is always willing to give advice on math, grad school, or anything else you may need. Very accommodating.","Jason is the best professor I've ever had!!! MATH 521 is notoriously difficult, but prof Metcalfe makes the material attainable. He cares a lot about his students and will spend the entire lecture on one proof if you are confused. Not the easiest prof, but you will definitely learn the material well.
