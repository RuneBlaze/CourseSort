It definitely helps to have grown up in a city and to have a good overview of city life before entering the class. Nothing is unattainable; you just have to work for it.

Good luck working for the \"A.\" Learned a lot in the course, but it screwed over my gpa."],"courses":["PLAN047","PLAN047H"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
