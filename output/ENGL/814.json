I only took this because it was open. not interested in Chaucer at all but became my favorite class! He is an amazing teacher and excellent at keeping you engaged! I would highly suggest taking a class from Prof O'Neill! Also he is CRAZY nice and in my top 3 professors at UNC, and don't get the book the translations are online for free..","He's an awesome teacher! He is really funny and makes a really boring subject interesting. He's a tough grader on papers but he's always willing to help.","Loved Prof. O'Neill! Made British Literature (which I think is a pretty dry subject) extremely interesting. He's great and makes it clear from the start what his expectations are. He's a tough grader, but he's more than willing to help with papers/presentations. Take him!","Great professor, really made Chaucer interesting.  Daily quizzes but just know your minor characters.  exams were tedious but no suprises, he gives you everything in his lectures.  Would take another class if he had one.  Very well recommended","Very good teacher, organized and interesting.  His tests are not cakewalks but you can make good grades with very modest amounts of studying.  The Chaucer book is not really needed, you are better off using online or paperback versions with line by line translation.","Great teacher.  Will learn a lot and have fun while doing it.","Funny guy, but grades pretty harshly. Must remember lots of dates and facts--not as much into interpretation--at least in the survey class I took with him. Makes class interesting, though, with his sense of humor!","he was good","excellent teacher, wants you to learn but also to enjoy learning","Had him for a summer course in Adult Ed.  A fab teacher and a good program organizer.  Great with the 20th cent. Irish poets.","One of my favorite English professors and one of the few I remember from my time in Chapel Hill. I definitely recommend him.","He's great - very helpful, smart, witty, and makes the whole class interesting and fun.  Take a class from him!","O'Neill rocks.  Very funny and a great teacher.  Take any class you can with him."],"courses":["ENGL320","ENGL120","ENGL120","ENGL320","ENGL320","ENGL120","ENGL120","ENGL23","ENGL","IRISHCULTURE","ENG","ENGL","ENGL237"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
