Her tests are basically small details from the readings and her opinions, which make choosing a definite answer tough. She doesn't give notes and lectures are a waste of time. Essays are easy and in class, but you must be prepared.","Really nice lady. Passionate about her field. Long lectures, expect to write papers. Reading is necessary. Definitely cannot B.S. your way through without reading a single page. Exam and essay questions come 100% from the readings. Participate, ask questions, share stories to make the time to go by. The class is very long and can be very boring.","Dr. Hastings is a nice lady. The class itself is interesting and so are the readings. It was an easy class but she frequently went off topic, her lectures were repetitive, she seemed to forgot that she already talked about something and would repeat it the next class. Her tests are very opinionated, making the \"true\" and \"false\" section difficult.","Confusing assignments and papers. Syllabus and rubrics are contradictory and unclear. Overall though I rarely went to class and crammed the night before tests and got a B.","Anne Hastings, in my opinion, should not be employed by UNC. She  constantly commits logical fallacies during class. Once lamenting the fact that her husband makes more than her as to be a social injustice. Her husband is an electrical engineer. Of course he's going to make more. Stuff like this ALL THE TIME. I wonder how she received a PhD.","She got arrested during the Moral Monday movement. Amazing little old lady.","Has she ever heard of making slides and actually teaching instead of reading off of her notes and expecting us to be able to follow her pace? No. Pretty useless and material could pretty much be self taught.","Worst professor I have ever had. Continuously fails to reply to emails and provides no help outside of the classroom. Avoid her if you can","This class was interesting but painful to get up for. There were a lot of typos on the test because the TAs make them. This class is not too hard, but it was still not as easy as you would think and it's easy to get behind. If you get behind on the MOUNDS of reading, it gets very difficult.","Super feisty! Awesome lady, very passionate about the subject. She definitely knows what she's talking about. The class material is fascinating, and you'll absolutely learn a lot just by coming to class.","If you take notes in class and know the key facts in the text, the exams aren't bad at all. However, several questions are arbitrary and have to do with opinion (specifically her own). Don't get on her bad side: teach's got a temper.","Very, very easy class. However, she is EXTREMELY liberal and makes her views on politics well-known. Her exams consist of what you learned and class and what you think her opinions are. If you aren't liberal, then you will be disgusted with her class. Overall, it's easy, but her political views make the class unbearable if you aren't liberal.","I enjoyed this class. She likes early morning classes but it's okay if you miss a few. Most of her topics are common sense. She does require you to read multiple novels, but nothing too hard or boring. Most say the class is just okay, but I think it's pretty interesting and fairly easy. If you don't make an A or at least a B, I'd be surprised.","She gives an elementary view of racism in America. She wastes time frequently, going on 10-15 tirades against petty whispering that no one notices.\r Her tests are largely based on her own personal opinions with no regard to statistics or facts. We spent the semester talking about black stereotypes, nothing else. Waste of time, easy B.","One of the easiest classes you can take. If you have any common sense you'll do fine. Very VERY basic view of sociology, you won't really learn much past what you know. She has a way of babying her students and somehow has this aura of her being greater than everyone else. Don't take it unless you need a requirement filled.","She really doesn't know much about the subject at hand and made some very un-sociological remarks throughout the semester.  Her workbook was pointless and you really got an elementary school explanation about racism and oppression.  I think the class was a complete waste of my time and money.  Are we really paying for this&#63;!&#63;!","She's easy -- she's interesting.  She's not the best professor in the world, but she's not bad either","THIS WAS MY 3RD CLASS WITH PROF HASTINGS AND IT WAS GREAT!! I TOOK A COURSE ONLINE.  SHE WAS VERY RESPONSIVE AND EASY TO REACH.  THE EXAM IS ONLINE AND YOU HAVE TO POST IT WITHIN 24 HRS.  THERE WERE 3 TESTS (INCLUDING THE MIDTERM) A FINAL JOURNAL AND DISCUSSION BOARD.  TAKE HER IF U CAN!!","Ok, so she says she wants it to be a real sociology class where personal opinions are not acted on as if they are fact; the class is however nothing but her opinion on things. Its a stupid class, don't bother. Except its required for the major, go figure. If this had been my first sociology class, I'd never have taken a second.","no comment"],"courses":["SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI122","SOCI101","SOCI101","SOCI122","SOC10","SOCI101","SOCI122","SOCI22","SOCI30","SOCI10","SOCI22"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"SOCI","catalog_nbr":122,"section":990,"class_nbr":11802,"title":"RACE & ETHNIC RELATIONS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
