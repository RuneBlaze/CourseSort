His POLI 444 class is challenging, yet refreshingly straightforward. Highly recommend both him and the class.","Dr. Bapat was fantastic, the lectures were easy to follow and he seemed approachable. His TA did the grading of the papers and some of the guidance on the essays could have been a bit more clear.","This class is very interesting and Professor Bapat is a great lecturer. He speaks clearly, all power points are online, and he is very dynamic so no risk of falling asleep. However, grading can be a little tough (I was surprised by my test grades) but I guess that depends on the grader for the class. Overall, great class.","Great professor.  Lectures were crystal clear and very well organized, plus he posted all the Powerpoints on Blackboard. Tests were kind of tricky, but came mostly from the lectures and considerably less from the readings, of which there were many.  Overall average difficulty, but well above average skill as a lecturer.","Great professor, really knows his subjects and lectures are very interesting and easy to follow.  Professional and fun professor.  Highly recommend","Very good professor, interesting lectures, knowledgable guy."],"courses":["POLI444","PWAD350","PWAD350","PWAD350","POLI195","PWAD350"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
