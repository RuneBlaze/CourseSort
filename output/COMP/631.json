Programming assignments are tedious and time consuming. Midterm questions are extensions of homework questions, but she doesn't give complete examples on how to do the problems. Do not take this class if you do not have to.","She was clear, dedicated, and worked hard to make the subject material as engaging as possible (although it is dry). I couldn't ask for anything more, especially given that it was her first time teaching the class. Some struggled but go to class, follow her instructions, skim the books, and it should be very straightforward.","I haven't met a professor who has been more responsive to the criticism of her students at UNC. Kind professor, decent lecturer, her+ the TAs are great to help during office hours. Only complaint is that she introduced some concepts from discrete math and other subjects that weren't prerequisites to the class, causing some students to struggle."],"courses":["COMP431","COMP410","COMP110"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
