The entire semester is spent writing an original thesis paper on the subject. It was daunting at first, but Tsin made the process incredibly enjoyable and rewarding. He had clear guidelines that helped along the way. I learned a lot and am happy I took the class!","Tsin was a great professor for History 133. The material was very interesting and I learned alot. The TA's grade your papers and he never sees them so be prepared to find a good TA. Enjoyable and pretty easy prof and teacher overall!","There are only 2 papers and 2 exams, if you didn't do well on one of them, there is no way for you to get an A. The materials are not very hard, but the grading completely depends on your TA. He does not even know what you write in a paper or exam.","Excellent teacher if you have any interest in the subject matter. Tends to go off on tangents but he is mostly enjoyable and a really friendly guy. Prepare to put some serious time into studying if you want an A though.","Sometimes hard to understand. Subject matter was pretty straightforward though, and much on pretty topical current events. Its a large class, with movies shown sometimes. Look out for weekly journal assignments."],"courses":["HIST398","HIST133","HIST133","HIST133","INTS210"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
