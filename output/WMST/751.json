Dr. Sheriff is super knowledgeable in her field and a great lecturer. There are 10 pop quizzes and the readings can get tedious and long. There are a LOT of papers worth a large portion but she gives rewrites (she's so great). The tests aren't hard at all if you pay attention in class.","Dr. Sheriff is a good professor- really sweet and passionate about art. The papers were a hard to get used to, but she allows rewrites. 10 pop quizzes on the readings throughout the semester that aren't too difficult, but need to read. Tests aren't too hard either as long as you paid attention in class. Lectures were not very visual analysis heavy","Dr. Sheriff is one of the nicest professors I've ever had here. She really cares. I would recommend this class to someone who's taken an art class previously because I was a little lost, but she really helped me out when things got confusing! Such a nice lady.","Professor Sheriff is definitely one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Really interesting class. You need to go to class the take the reading quizzes and learn from the lectures, but it's all very interesting!","Without a doubt, the most interesting, supportive professor that I have ever had.","One of the best teachers on this campus or any campus.","Best professor I ever had. Supportive, generous with her time, brilliant.","No Comments"],"courses":["ARTH254","ARTH254","ARTH254","ARTH254","ART","ARTHISOTRY","18THCART","ART"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
