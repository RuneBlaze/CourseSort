If you go to class and take advantage of office hours you'll do well. Expectations are very clear, lectures are interesting and engaging. Best professor I've had at unc.","Absolutely amazing professor! He is always there for his students! However, his FYS was a very difficult class. Expect many hard papers, 300 pages of reading a week, and a very difficult final project. Although it was hard, his willingness to help and clarify made it all a really rewarding experience. I learned a lot and he makes boring things cool","Good professor. His lectures are very clear and easy to follow. It is easy to take notes in his class. The downside is all the reading, and the way it is split up. Sometimes you read 2 pages in a weekend and sometimes you read 300- just depends on the particular topic. He goes over readings in class though! I only did 1st half of  readings -got B+","This class was one of the best that I have had at UNC. The lectures discussed the important points from the readings, and engages the class within the subject. The discussion sections reinforced the topics that were needed for the class, but he had good TAs. If you ever need him, he is more than willing to talk to you. An overall awesome professor.","He lays out every lesson very clearly; the content of the course is easy to follow.  Very interesting class, but there is quite a bit of reading."],"courses":["GERM270","GERM56","GERM270","GERM270","GERM270"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
