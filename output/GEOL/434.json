Joel just is not a very good teacher. I would not recommend taking his class if you are looking for an easy  A or B.","Professor Hudley was pretty awful. He seems like he would be a cool guy to hangout with but he was an awful teacher. I had him for prehistoric life and prehistoric life lab--- he doesn't answer questions preferring that you Google them, lectures on tons of material every class, anddd basically you don't learn anything.","Tests are insane, some of them do not contain course material. Should create new ways to keep students engaged rather than reading slides on the board. Do not take geology, UNC has a bad geology program with professors that do not respond to you and are happy with a 70 class average. Lab was the same way and we never even met that professor.","This is not a difficult class if you're willing to put in a bit of effort. All of the lecture slides are placed on the course site (which is extremely generous), and if you take the lab in conjunction with the lecture, you get extra review. Joel can seem brusque to southerners, but it's simply his New York demeanor. Don't be intimidated. He's nice.","Completely useless as a professor. He will tell you to google answers instead of teaching. He has no control of the class and talks about pop culture instead of answering student's questions. No study guides are given and exam questions can come from material not covered in class. You will learn nothing and get a bad grade. Don't take as a GE!!","As a person, he's great. Love the man. But as a professor, he's pretty awful. He goes way too fast, and he goes too in-depth for an introductory course. And of course, he expects you know extremely specific information for the exams.","He seemed nice at first, but turned out to be unhelpful, not understanding when people didn't automatically understand a concept. He is bad at explaining, goes really fast, and he's boring. Don't expect an easy science course by signing up for his class.","lecture is interesting because he makes jokes a lot, but he is not as good of a lecturer as melissa hudley.  Also, melissa hudley offers about 3 or 4 points overall more extra credit than he does, so definitely try to get her instead of Joel."],"courses":["GEOL215","GEOL159","GEOL101","GEOL101","GEOL159","GEOL159","GEOL101","GEOL101"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","POOR"]}}]
