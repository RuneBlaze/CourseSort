He gives a huge curve, though, so I somehow got an A.","By far the least approachable professor I have ever encountered. Tried on multiple occasions to talk with him/ask questions after class and he was openly condescending every time. Lectures themselves weren't riveting but the subject is interesting enough. Fine as a Gen Ed if you read the textbook.","Lecture is very boring and feels to go on forever. I would not recommend this class with this professor to anyone.","I had to pinch myself awake in every lecture- so boring. I kept up on textbook readings and by the end of the year, after reading cover to cover, only managed to pull a low B. I still don't understand where most of his test questions were from. On the first test there were questions from future chapters so there is really no good way to study.","Overall, great professor.  He really knows his stuff.  He's also lenient on class attendance and turning in assignments, he understands if you're busy.  He grades fairly easily, but that is not to say that he makes the class easy, he still expects you to learn the material.","He's a nice guy but has very boring lectures. The topics are applicable and that's the only plus I see. Tests are really hard. There's so much information covered for each one and he never pulls the important points.","cocky yet okay teacher.  his tests are annoying though, asking questions like &quot;how many people died in this event&#63;&quot; and ignoring the important concepts.","Lectures are very dull and do not cover most of material on test.  Can skip class without any problems.  Massive curves make difficult tests more bearable.","Attendance not mandatory. Posts recordings of his lecture online. His exam questions are ridiculously specific and can include topics from future chapters. Boring class.","very straight foward course, tends to be dull at times but overall not that bad. just read the book and review his powerpoint lectures and youll do fine.","Horrible professor. Extremely dull lectures. Your final grade comes from the three exams and the final, which is impossible because he tests on material that are not in his lectures or in the text.  Awful class - take something else to fill the requirement.  Geol 101 Lab was very easy and interesting.","His non-mandatory attendance and online voice lectures make it really attempting to not go, but you should. his grade distribution/curves help in the beginning, but can screw you over in the end. so study hard and just stay ahead of the curve =) one of the easier sciences for a sci req","Lectures are boring but going always helps. He posts his lectures and voice lectures online, so it makes it really hard to go to class. The exams are hard because you never know what to study for.","Very boring class.  His exams arent bad but his final doesnt matter if you study or not because the stuff he ask is retarded and you guess on anyway","Definitely knows his stuff. Lectures can be kinda boring when they have a lot of statistics & graphs but the subject is interesting. Notes are posted online so it's ok if you miss class, but read the book b/c notes and lecture don't cover it all. Really approachable guy, good sense of humor. Offers research opportunities (ie: volcanoes in Ecuador)","He knows what he is talking about, but can't make the material interesting. His lectures are all slides of graphs and pictures which are hard to take notes on and your grade depends on 3 tests all year long, so there isn't anyhting to boost it with. Not the best class, but good to fulfill your science requirement","Fantastic lecturer! Material not always the most interesting, but works hard to make it so. Will answer any questions you have about material and is very enthusiastic. Uses multimedia lectures to great effect. If you show up, take notes, and do the reading, you'll do fine. Recommended making detailed chapter summaries of reading.","Hilarious professor, nice guy. You just can't challenge his knowledge in the field of Geology."],"courses":["GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL520","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL1055","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL105","GEOL13","GEOL13","GEOL13","GEOL13","GEOL013"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
