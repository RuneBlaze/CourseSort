He doesn't offer any meaningful insight or analysis but relies on slow, soft-headed class discussion. Classes are tedious and fruitless. Compares unfavorably to most instructors. An unreasonably tough grader for the low quality of the course.","The novels he picks are interesting, but his discussions aren't. It's nice that he truly wants feedback from students. Unfortunately, the class time felt like a caricature of an English class: a lot of his analysis didn't match the text. On top of that, he grades harshly. A B is doable, but don't expect to be engaged during class.","Dr. Taylor was an amazing professor: he gave great lectures, chose awesome novels, and was all-around funny, nice, and inspiring. Really willing to helptalk about assignments. He's a tough grader, I'm not going to lie, but you really grow as a writer and critical thinker. I've learned to look at literature in a totally new way thanks to him!","Good professor. Takes the material and papers very seriously. Easier to talk to 1 on 1 than you might imagine. He is kind and fair. Do the readings, though- he likes to give 'pop quizzes' on the material that make it really obvious if you haven't done the reading. Proofread your essays carefully!","He values students' feedback and is a very insightful prof. He's fun and engaging, but take the papers seriously, they're no joke! His Popular Genres class is especially great, we read detective novels, sci-fi, and Batman among other texts covered in this course. I also took American lit with him which was just as good.","He's a great professor; he strikes a good balance between productive class discussion and a little lecturing when we needed it. He provides lots of feedback and grades fairly. He's approachable and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!","I really loved taking a class with Prof. Taylor; he teaches the American Novel as a popular genres course, which most professors do not do. He brings up interesting discussions and leads class well. He's a very tough grader though, so run ideas for papers by him before writing them"],"courses":["ENG347","ENGL347","ENGL347","ENGL89","ENGL347344","ENGL261","ENGL347"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
