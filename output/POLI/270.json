It's not an easy course for anyone just to slack and get a good grade, but if you work for it, it's surely worth it. Professor is super helpful, friendly, and inspiring. Class discussion is always in a great atmosphere. professor smiles when you talk to her, and she gets so excited when someone come up with good thoughts!","Professor Bickford is a great professor. The first year seminar I took with her is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at UNC. If you're taking it because you expect an easy A, you probably won't get it. But the class discussions are incredibly interesting, and you will improve your writing and analytical thinking skills.","Great prof!  Really let's everybody tell what they think about the questions at hand.  Also, she's very serious about participation so don't think that you can join her class and not talk or do the readings, which can get dull at times.  However, the great discussions make it all worth it.","I had her for Feminism in Political Theory, great teacher, SO passionate about this topic, but you definitely have to do the readings, which are usually quite long and sometimes really difficult"],"courses":["POLI270","POLI89","POLI270","POLI265"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
