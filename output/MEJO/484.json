I say lecturing because he does not teach much, leaving you to ask him directly how to do things or look up demos on what you want to attempt to do. Grades are based on well how he likes you more than your actual work.","Terence goes above and beyond to help his students. He will meet with you after class or talk with you so you can really excel. He is always pushing us to the next level and casts lots of vision. His example and passion really helped me get excited about design and what I could do with it. Any design class you take with him will be worth it","I took this class as a senior and the one thing that I took away from it was that Terence is a very frustrating professor. He barely teaches anything yet expects you to perform at a professional level. Now that I am in the working environment, I realize that he was a poor professor."],"courses":["JOMC182","JOMC483","JOMC484"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
