She warms up to her students and really cares about them learning as much as possible. You have to do the reading, which is sometimes a lot, but there is no final and the whole grade is based off of the paper you work on throughout the semester in groups. I loved this class!","Professor Tyson was by far the most passionate prof. I had my freshman year. Her class was difficult and she expected a lot out of her freshman but she is really not as scary as she seems and cares about her students and their success.","This class was very engaging and discussion-based. The reading was required, but interesting. Tyson is brilliant. However, she is a bit inaccessible. You have to put in quite a bit of effort to build any sort of relationship. Also, she will not respond to emails that she does not think are important, which is very frustrating and a bit rude.","Professor Tyson is really great. At first, she is extremely intimidating but as the semester goes on she is very friendly and works well with the students. She genuinely cares about improving students writing and works with you to improve. The class material is very interesting but be sure to do the reading ahead of time.","Her first year seminar on equality of educational opportunity is really interesting with a light workload at first that steadily increases to a HUGE workload by the end of the semester. Professor Tyson is pretty intimidating, but incredibly brilliant and helpful if you just seek her out yourself. Always do the readings and come prepared to talk.","She seems super scary on the first day, but she eventually warms up. Definitely go to every class and take all the quizzes - they are fine if you do the readings and have an opinion. Bad with email and ignores what she doesn't want to deal with. See the TA for help with the final paper, and things surprisingly work out! Was happy with my grade.","She's a really tough teacher, but not so bad once you get to know her. Go to the quizzes, study and do the readings and you will be fine. She's pretty engaging though the intensity wears out by the end of the semester. The final is super short and easy because of the paper.","Weekly quizzes graded 0, 5 or 10.  She's very picky with the answers she accepts so most people get fives. There's also a 15 page paper at the end and an apples requirement.Its not an easy class but its worth the work. She's very passionate and knows her stuff. She's very good at engaging her students.She seems intimidating, but shes actually nice."],"courses":["SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI064","SOCI423","SOCI423","SOCI423"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
