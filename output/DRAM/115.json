Since reading and understanding the plays is too easy he adds random/way too specific questions in the tests to get some points off. His TA's grade the paper harshly.","SOOOOOOO easy. Easiest A of all time. Extra credit paper boosts your grade up a letter. 8am sucks, but you all you'll remember is that A on your transcript. Simplest HW ever. Read sparknotes before tests and go over notes a time or two and you are set. 10/10 would recommend.","Hands down the easiest class I have taken at UNC. Just attend class, take good notes, and READ (duh). The extra credit paper bumps your grade up half a letter. You go watch an extra play and write a brief review (takes 30 minutes). His lectures are interesting and bearable for 8ams twice a week and no recitation :)","Although this class is at 8AM, it is worth it to take it. You don't have to attend the lectures, and as long as you read the plays you will be fine on all the exams. There is no cumulative final which is pretty nice.  Easy A for sure.","Great class. The tests are very easy and minimal studying is required. Weekly homework is a sentence to a paragraph long. Just read spark notes on the plays. At times the lecture tends to get boring. Extremely clear expectations in class.","Easy A class as long as you go to lecture and read the Sparknotes for the plays. Homework assignments every week are easy, as are the tests. Would definitely recommend as an easier class, if you're willing to get up at 8 AM.","I skipped class half the time, as did most people I assume. EXTREMELY uninteresting lectures. And at 8 in the morning I'd rather sleep in.","Really nice guy! An 8 am was not exactly my cup of tea, but he (sometimes) made it worth it. Tests are pretty easy if you read the texts; also, during required productions, it may serve your best interests to jot down a few things about the scenery. Very understanding during office hours and doesn't make you feel small if you need clarification.","Truly not a bad class. You really need to read the plays (but sparknotes works wonders) and it really does help to attend lectures because his tests pull from random things he says in class. Relatively easy A/B if you're willing to read/sparknote the plays and show up to class. I recommend it. Defintely a 'breather' course.","He was a nice guy, but the class was really boring.  A lot of people didn't show up to class, and I can understand why.  The exams were pretty easy, though he occassionally threw in random questions he had never gone over.","Good teacher, especially for an 8am class. It's a relatively easy class if you read and watch the required plays, and go to class once in a while.","Go to classes for the small quizzes and get your work in all time. It's an easy A.","easy class... go take notes in lecture and read. that's all you have to do to get a good grade. he's a pretty funny guy too although some of the material is dry.","ok so I hardly ever went to this class, but when I did he was a nice guy, funny comments during his lectures...basically an easy A if you read the plays a day before the exams.","Don't take this class in the morning, you will fall asleep. The upside to falling asleep is that you won't miss much. He basically reads the plays to the class and highlights the main stuff to know. The test were okay. Make sure you read the plays. And he does like to throw in stuff that he never mentioned, like the introduction stuff.","I liked this class overall. I'll admit that at times I was bored, but that was usually because I wasn't especially interested in the particular play he was talking about. If you read the plays and pay attention, this course is an easy A. The test questions come straight from the text and the lectures, and the final paper is leniently graded.","man tha class was aight but dude asks questions on exams that he doesn't go over and its irritating","Easiest class I've taken so far. Read the plays, do the one-sentence HW assignments for each, and you'll do fine. Three tests, one final paper, and an optional extra credit paper. The final is not cumulative- just about the last few plays.","Adamson is a VERY easy professor.  His exams are multiple choice of about 30 questions.  I made an A in that class and all I did was reread the plays before the exams and did fine.  I recommend this teacher for an EASY A, but he is REALLY BORING!!!  All he does is talk during the whole class period.  Just take notes, read the plays twice, & ur good","No Comments"],"courses":["DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAMA115","DRAMA115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM15","DRAMA15"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR"]}},{"subject":"DRAM","catalog_nbr":115,"section":3,"class_nbr":1268,"title":"PERSPECTIVES IN DRAMA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Carroll","room":"0111","days":"MWF","time":"13","instructor":"KABLE,GREGORY A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":400,"enrl_tot":93,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=38308","fname":"Gregory","lname":"Kable","quality":"3.7","easiness":"2.2","help":"2.2","clarity":"2.2","topTag":"Hilarious (4)","grade":"2.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["AMAZING LECTURES","EXTRA CREDIT","TOUGH GRADER","HILARIOUS","HILARIOUS","GROUP PROJECTS","AMAZING LECTURES","HILARIOUS"],"comments":["Kable's lectures are fantastic! I never thought I would enjoy a drama class but we read so many different plays I had never heard of that I thoroughly loved. He's funny and tries really hard to make everything relatable. I really like his interpretation and analysis of each and every play and how he connects it to contemporary culture. Take him!","Kable is quite a character (in a good way)! Never thought I would enjoy a drama class, but the plays we read actually aren't bad at all. If you go to lecture and actually jot down what he's saying (and do other crap the entire time) you'll ace the tests. It's all pretty straightforward and Kable is a fun guy.","Okay so Drama 115 should be an easy A right? Not with this professor. I made a B- with a lot of effort as compared to friends with no work and A's with another professor. The tests are half true and false, which are extremely easy to confuse so don't think of true and false as something easy. He talks the entire hour with slides with literally pics","Loved Greg! He's hilarious in an eccentric way. The assignment descriptions are not entirely clear, but as long as you put in a visible amount of work, he'll appreciate your effort. Definitely recommend for anyone, not just people interested in drama!","very eccentric, love him to death. took DRAM81H, was super fun and an easy A! highly recommend","Prof. Kable makes his lectures fun.  I had him for DRAM 292: The American Musical.  His lectures are full of comedy and videos that explain exactly what he is talking about.  While his grading rubrics are always the clearest, if you need help, it's definitely there.  Attendance policy is very strict.  GO TO CLASS!!!","Professor Kable clearly loves Drama, and this drama class is really fun and gets rid of a lot of GENEDS.  Its not too hard at all, and his grading criteria for essays is always very specific so you know what to do to get a good grade.  Definitely recommend this seminar.","My 2nd class with Kable. I love him- favorite professor here. Makes my day bright with clips from Lady Gaga concert footage, Mean Girls, Glee, and Pitch Perfect.","This class is completely doable.  Kable makes the subject interesting and when I took this class last spring it was easy to do well if you did the assigned readings and came to class.  The paper is daunting at first, but it really isn't that bad once you get started.  Would definitely recommend!","Take this class with this professor! He is absolutely great! Makes a dull non-major subject very interesting. I was dreading this course when I enrolled but it is definitely one of my favorite classes that I have taken. Kable is the man!","His personality will strike you, he's funny and witty although he won't look like it at first glance. Very passionate about theatre and is enthused with class participation. Test we multiple choice and true/false so they could be tricky, but they were generally easy if you pay attention to lecture","Great professor! No homework outside of a few papers/group project. Not a lot of work and an easy grader. Class is mandatory (with the exception of a few absences he'll excuse) but reading is not mandatory. As long as you read up on sparknotes before class you can generally be fine in the class discussions which are voluntary to speak in.","Funny and clever but lectures are often monotonous, tests are confusing.","A really fascinating lecturer but his tests are confusing and difficult.","He was one of my favorite teachers. such a great class to go to.","This class was pretty easy. Kable's lectures aren't that boring, considering that it's drama. If you take good notes and are good at memorization, you'll be fine.","Prof. Kable is great! He's a really nice guy, and is very passionate about theatre.  He relates all of the plays to today by comparing them with movies and TV shows today.  There are four essays a semester, including the final exam.  There is almost never any homework besides reading plays.","Professor Kable is passionate about what he teaches and makes classes interesting. Makes drama enjoyable even to those who are not interested in the arts","I love Greg. He's interesting and knowledgeable and it's obvious that he cares about teaching. Make sure you know the information on the study sheets and you'll be golden on tests. Attendance isn't mandatory, but class is always interesting; he shows film clips every day and often gives extra credit.","The A was much harder to get than it should've been with my prior knowledge because TAs arbitrarily grade papers (mine had only a 3 word comment) and test questions can be ambiguous even with studying. Still, it's a fun class with an entertaining professor. Start the paper early and come every day in case he gives EC (esp days right after tests)."],"courses":["DRAM285H","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM81H","DRAM81H","DRAM292","DRAM81H","282","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM120","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAMA115","DRAM81","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"DRAM","catalog_nbr":115,"section":2,"class_nbr":1266,"title":"PERSPECTIVES IN DRAMA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Manning","room":"0209","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"CORNELL,JEFFREY B","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":150,"enrl_tot":138,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=365603","fname":"Jeff","lname":"Cornell","quality":"3.6","easiness":"2.7","help":"2.7","clarity":"2.7","topTag":"LECTURE HEAVY (3)","grade":"2.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY","CARING","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["His tests are tricky as there's a bunch of random quotes you have to identify but the papers were pretty fair. Rambles a lots a in lecture and you watch videos which he will usually ask a couple questions on tests. Nice guy but don't take if you're looking for an easy A.","Went to office hours to look over a test and was given a 45 minute individual backstage tour of the playmakers theatre! Lectures can linger on but are much better (and helpful) if you actually do the reading when it's supposedly due.","Would not recommend this class. Babbles through lectures about information you won't be tested on. Picks random quotes from the plays and you have to identify who said it. NOT AN EASY A.","He uses the same questions from old tests except quotes are different. I never went to class and did completely fine. There are 2 papers but they are both outlined for you in the syllabus so they are pretty easy","I would definitely recommed this class.  All you have to do is read the plays and playwrights once (or twice if you really feel like it), and write 2 5-page papers.  The papers could have been graded better, but the tests (which were all mc) were easy!","Professor Cornell substituted for Professor Strong for Drama 116. He gave us a comprehensive study-guide for the final, so you didn't even have to attend class. AND he's super good looking!!!","Does everything he can to lure you into useless lectures. Babbles about plays whole class, none of the discussion is on test. Doesnt tell when he gives back poorly graded papers so you come to every stupid class. Does not tell you when exams are handed  either. must go 2 class to get answer keys and exams, puts nothing on line. Not recommended.","TA's grade papers... hard. Wrote an awesome paper discussing play I went and saw and gave me a B for my grammar. Lectures are OK, but tests have dumb questions and trivia such as dates, random quotes and overly picky items. I read plays and paid attention, should have been an easy A. However, Tests and papers were way too thorough and picky.","I went into this class thinking &quot;easy A.&quot; However, i was quickly proven wrong. Tests are MC but VERY picky. Asks random trivia from the text book and class sessions. His TA's grade essay's far too harshly. He gives 5 assignments, 2 essays, 3 exams--these are your only chance for grades, NO extra credit.On the upside, he is passionate about drama.","Yes his TA's grade papers, but I got a's both times. He is very enthusiastic and makes class interesting. The tests were easy all you have to do is read the plays. If you enjoy reading diff. plays about diff. cultural events and time periods you'll enjoy this class and he makes it very interesting. No homework besides reading","His TAs grade the papers really hard for stupid things, so this is pretty much a freshman english class--no joke. His lectures are completely boring, he just reads from the textbook which is overpriced, and he puts random trivia in exams that is sometimes not even mentioned in class. I do not recommend him.","No Comments","very interested in his topic and makes the subject more entertaining","Amazing!  He's so helpful if you go to his office hours.","He's an alright teacher.  Didn't show up to class much and still made a B.  Watch out for your papers, he grades HARD!","Super nice and fun.
