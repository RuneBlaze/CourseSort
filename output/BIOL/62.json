He obviously does not want to teach and makes it clear to you just how little he enjoys is as compared to his research. His tests are a little difficult and the material is awful, lots of random specific details that don't relate to anything.","He taught the developmental section of the class.  He's very condescending and just a jerk in general.  Wish I had taken the other section of BIOL 205 that he didn't teach.  Try to avoid him","Best teacher I've had from the biology department.  He's a bit quirky, like he wears funny hats to class a lot and actually brought in a live chicken one day, but that's what makes him so fun.  His tests are thorough, but fair, and he explains things well.  He's also really helpful outside of class.","No Comments","Very good about explaining things thourougly, but he is kinda out there though.  Great pictures in his slides too."],"courses":["BIOL205","BIOL205","BIOL205","BIO52BIO169","BIO52"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
