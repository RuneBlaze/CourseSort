She will MAKE SURE you understand concepts. And there's not much work If you aren't the best at understanding Spanish, it may be slightly difficult to understand her, but she's great.  She brings you candy almost every day (like Lindt Truffles)","One of my favorite professors at UNC.  Professor Hsu enjoyed the subject she was teaching and she was able to get us interested in it too.  The class was mainly discussion based and the readings weren't too bad.  Prof. Hsu was very helpful and she was easy to contact and approach for help when needed.","The best Spanish professor I've had.  Her lectures are engaging and fairly often hilarious.  She's super nice (brings candy to every test!) and exceedingly helpful during office hours.  She makes medieval/Golden Age Spain absolutely fascinating, and I feel like I've learned so much!  Absolutely recommended.","She is very interested in teaching and tries hard to make sure the class understands everything. She is very energetic and helpful, and has a good sense of humor.","No Comments","Really fun teacher to take. Very helpful and makes Spanish learning very fun..."],"courses":["SPAN255","ROML59","SPAN371","SPAN371","SPAN371","SPAN71"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
