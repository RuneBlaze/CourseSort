Always gives good feedback, but she is very serious about plagiarism. All the work checked by plagramme  plagiarism checker.","Wegel is the best professor I have ever had!!! I LOVE HER! She is absolutely hilarious and couldn't be more helpful when you ask. I will try to take as many classes as possible with her.  Participation and homework are huge percentages of the grade, so although tests are mediocre, it is still really easy to get an A.  Lots of grades, which is nice.","Awesome professor and very interesting class. I learned a lot from her. Definitely reccommend. Expect homework and usually reading every night. Mid-term, final, 3-4 quizzes and 4 papers. The hard work is worth it for sure, and she will help you improve your German.","Dr. Wegel is an overall amazing professor, even though the course readings are often \"sehr langweilig\" and definitely a little weird. She really wants students to succeed and tries to grade according to amount of effort rather than correctness. The class itself only had a midterm and a final which was a lot different for me. A+ professor.","I have taken two classes with Dr. Wegel, German 301 and 302, and both have been great. As head of the department, she is the preeminent German  instructor at UNC. Do whatever you can to get in a class with her (but if you have the choice, R. Langston is really, really great as well). Assignments clear, super nice grader.","If you have any choice in the matter, take your German course with Frau Dr. Wegel: laid back, funny, and (most importantly) the fairest grader of them all. The 203 format has a ton of homework, but realistically, effort is being graded√¢??not mastery.","Excellent professor, great class. Super friendly and willing to help out side of class.","One of the best teachers I've ever had.  Funny and smart and really interested in helping the students learn to appreciate the subject matter as much as she does.  I'd definitely recommend a course by her.","Excellent teacher! She's very helpful and I'd recommend any of her classes highly. There is quite a bit of homework, but it's not unmanageable.","Awesome professor! Great class! Wish I could take it over just for fun. :)A few pop quizzes that are only hard if you don't do the homework.","A really cool german teacher.  She is german of course, and is really friendly.  There is quite a bit of HW for 301, but its easy, jsut time consuming.  I recommend the class a lot.  She makes the class fun through the readings and listening to music and watching videos."],"courses":["GERM301","GERM203","GERM301","GERM301","GERM302","GERM203","GERM203","GERM303","GERM204","GERM203","GERM301"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
