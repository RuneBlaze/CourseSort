Henning was good one-on-one, but in the lecture hall is not too exciting to listen to. He'll tell you what you need to know but doesn't try to make it exciting for you. He also often rants on about why he's teaching how he's teaching instead of just teaching. He'll get the point across, but could easily just do it in fewer words.","Smart and funny guy who is really willing to work with you to help you figure things out.","Professor Henning is about as engaging a physics teacher can get. The lectures go by pretty fast. He's funny which makes the class better along with his ability to explain things. Definitely recommend.","There is a lot of homework. The lectures involve clickers and group disucssions, making it engaging. The labs can be a drag sometimes. There's a lot of material to cover, so it's important to make sure you don't get behind. He explains things pretty clearly.","Professor Henning certainly maximizes his 50 minutes.  Peppered with quirky physics humor, his teaching style is straightforward and well-paced. If you ever find yourself with a question, he happily spends a few minutes discussing it during or after class.  Certainly a good lecturer and highly recommend him for your physics course needs!","Dr. Henning worked hard to ensure the material was better explained and more intuitive than previous introductory level physics classes , and he largely succeeded. The class was difficult, but he seems to be working diligently to continually improve the course. Besides first time kinks, he has created an exemplary model for science classes."],"courses":["PHYS119","PHYS118","PHYS119","PHYS118","PHYS118","PHYS118"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":10,"class_nbr":8678,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"QIN,LU-CHANG","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":12,"class_nbr":9652,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"CLEMENS,JAMES C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":5,"class_nbr":8673,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"WU,YUE","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=483610","fname":"Yue","lname":"Wu","quality":"3.1","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"Get ready to read (1)","grade":"3.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Professor Wu is a very nice man, and wants the class to do well. The only problem is that he's not good at helping the class do well. One lecture might cover a whole chapter, another might cover one or two sections of a chapter. He spends too long on derivations, and not enough time ensuring class understanding. Prepare to teach yourself","Considering the overall quality of teachers in this department, he's not bad.  He knows his stuff, but is not very clear so you don't loose much by not coming.  Schroeder's book was very helpful...usually much clearer than Wu.  Tests are not very difficult.  Fair in partial credit, so at least put down the correct formula if you are out of time.","Great professor and great person. Once you get over accent, very very helpful.

There was very little homework and the material is super interesting. He's hilarious and I enjoyed his lectures. The class was an easy A but he does throw trick questions on exams. This class does involve math and physics but if you're fairly good at science then you'll  be fine.","This class was supposed to be an easy A, but when he told us top 25% of the class make an A I got really upset. I made a C+ in this class because a lot of students cheated on the final and pushed my grade back. Worst grading scale ever, especially when I worked my butt off for this class. Do NOT recommend for fulfilling a gen-ed.","Reichart is a prof that knows the material backwards and forwards. He's a great guy and hilarious. All of the lectures are found online. The tests are copy and paste from the webassign, just use the webassign answer key and you're good to go. It's a very easy class, he drops lowest test and 2 HW grades. Would recommend for nonscience majors.","Took his Astro 101 class. Gives very clear and informative lectures, but gives tests often on specific trivia that was never covered in class.","Dr. Reichart is an extremely qualified, funny, and kind professor. His lectures are usually very interesting and (except for the telescope selection unit) the material covered is fascinating and will help you better understand the world around you. I took this course purely because it sounded interesting, and would definitely recommend it.","I went to the lectures and used an allowed \"cheat sheet\"  full of lecture notes and I only passed 1 test. Everything is graded on a curve which sounds great right? Except in any other science course a 70 is a C. In this class a 70 was an F. You had to make in the 80's to get a C. Tests were not on lecture material. They were mostly physics problems","Reichart is a great guy who is very passionate. The class itself is not hard. Just do the homework and make cheat sheets (he allows one per test) for the tests and you will be just fine.","The class sounds like it would be easy, but the cheat sheets barely help because he asks trick questions. Using the textbook to do the homework will get you a zero, he seems to appreciate only his own ideas. When asking him for help he replies with one sentence or nothing at all, and if you go to office hours you better come prepared","Reichart is adorable and funny.  He is very knowledgable about the subject, and you can see that in his excitement for the course.  Class is insanely easy and very interesting.  He drops your lowest test and homework, and if you do an extra credit paper you get a second homework dropped - plus you can bring notes to exams.  Math is minimal and easy","If you are at UNC and looking to take care of your science requirement, this is probably the best science class to take. The professor lets you bring in \"cheat sheets\" with formulas and information for the multiple choice tests, which are very helpful. Beware - he likes to test on facts/trivia that he mentions once in class and never again.","Reichart he's hard and there's a lot of studying by yourself...","This was a fantastic course, and I absolutely enjoyed Reichart as my professor!!  He's funny, clear in his lectures, and he makes the topics interesting! Take this if you need a science requirement, you'll love it!","Lectures are entertaining, and if you don't want to go he will post them online. If you go to office hours he will all but give you the answers on the homework. He is very very helpful! The only negative things is that he uses web assign, which costs an extra $60, but he will let you use older versions of the text book.","Reichart is a good prof and his lectures were interesting. However, he was not very organized and his notes in class were terrible. The class is graded on a curve, so it only depends how well you do against others. Not a very hard class at all, and easy to get an A or B. Take him if you're interested in astro.","If you are interested at all in astronomy or need a GPA padding course, take Astro 101 with Professor Reichart!  He is extremely funny during lectures (albeit nerdy funny) and the homework is  easy and not time-consuming.  The tests aren't extremely difficult and you get a cheat sheet.  He drops your lowest test grade and 2 lowest homework grades!!","Boring lectures, trick questions on tests and webassign homeworks. only good thing is that you get to have a cheat sheet for exams. Dont take this if you don't have to. He also grades on a weird curve that could hurt you more than help you. Sometimes a 97 on the homeworks is a B. He also doesn't do his own office hours.","Professor Reichart is great! He gives interesting, engaging lectures. All homework is online and all the tests are multiple choice.  He is not very personable however.","We &lt;3 Reichart!!!!","He may be interesting, but he is the most uncaccessible professor! He does not relally like to give A's to his students. He only loves to hear himself. Never avaible during office hours, by the time he responds, you already figured it out, and that could be 2 days. His lab instructor though,  Dr Couze is terrific. By the way, got  a B.","He's awesome. Take the class just to have him. Lecture Notes aren't great, but tests come straight from the online notes and hw, so use that, and take advantage of his cheat sheet rules on each test"],"courses":["ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTRO101","101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTRO101","ASTR101","ASTRO101","ASTR101","ASTRO101","ASTR101","ASTR101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":7,"class_nbr":8675,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"LAW,NICHOLAS M","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2146214","fname":"Nicholas","lname":"Law","quality":"0.0","easiness":"N/A","help":"N/A","clarity":"N/A","topTag":"","grade":"N/A","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":[],"courses":[],"courseRatings":[]}},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":8,"class_nbr":8676,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"HEITSCH,FABIAN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2111033","fname":"Fabian","lname":"Heitsch","quality":"0.0","easiness":"N/A","help":"N/A","clarity":"N/A","topTag":"","grade":"N/A","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":[],"courses":[],"courseRatings":[]}},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":295,"section":9,"class_nbr":8677,"title":"RESEARCH WITH FACULTY I","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"LOPEZ,RENE","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1447306","fname":"Rene","lname":"Lopez","quality":"4.0","easiness":"4.0","help":"4.0","clarity":"4.0","topTag":"","grade":"4.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":[],"comments":["Professor Lopez is very nice and very willing to help if you go to office hours.

If given the opportunity, you should take a class with this professor.","Hands down the best professor I've ever had. This is the second course I've had with him and both were amazing.
