A nice teacher but could be a boringbad lecturer.","She was a good teacher. I had her for a FYS. It was my highest grade, and my easiest class my first semester of my first year. Great teacher! Nice lady! Cool class! Thumbs up.","I loved this class! Her lectures were usually engaging, and I thought she did a good job of explaining the sometimes confusing concepts. Lots of tests = each test covered less material, each test not worth as much = better grades. Challenging yet interesting class - one of my favorites so far at UNC.","multiple choice part of test not as difficult as essay.  Tends to run out of time.  Will help you if you approach her.
