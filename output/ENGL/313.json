She's a stickler on style. Can be harsh in grading, but she'll really work with you and give lots of good comments. English 315 is especially fun because she gets very passionate about the material. Plus she's been at UNC for a long time, so she has a lot of interesting stories about various colleagues.","I had Ms. Eble along with her colleague Ms. Brown for the freshman seminar \"Interpreting the South from Manuscripts.\" Ms. Eble is a hard grader, but she will make your writing so much better. The class itself I found to be very interesting as it is completely discussion and raw-reading based.  My favorite class of the semester!","Do not take her class unless you want to go home every night and teach yourself the subject. And, even after that don't expect to get an A in her tests because what you answered was not what she expected. When you talk to her she doesn't really seem to want to help. Also, she is very \"my way of the highway\" kind of person if you try to correct her.","This is my second class with Eble and I'm enjoying it even more than the last. She's willing to work with you--if you have a problem, she'll show you grace! She's a lot of fun and extremely knowledgeable in her field. Plus, the classes she teaches are always very interesting.","Eble is so interesting and entertaining! She is extremely knowledgeable and when you ask a question (which you always should!), she gives you a great, informative answer. She reminds me of my grandma, if my grandma could speak Old English. I've enjoyed taking her History of English class and I look forward to another class with her next semester.","I would NOT recommend the  freshman seminar \"Interpreting the south through manuscripts.\" This class was completely awful. All of the papers we turned in were supposed to be analysis, however all she really wanted was a summary of the documents. She's a very \"my way or the highway\" person. I found her paper comments very rude and unhelpful.","This grammar class was useful and informative.  The nature of the material makes details matter. This professor is extremely knowledgeable, and I found her helpful. Few of my classmates knew as much about grammar as they thought they did. Some were offended when they were corrected on things they should have learned in (or before) high school.","She was very boring.  One day it snowed and many students were missing.  She proceeded to take out the dictionary and for 1 1/2 hours, read words from the dictionary and talked about their origins.  A complete waste of my time!","she tends to over explain things, which makes her class pretty boring, but you hear the same thing so many times you won't need to study much at home. she is very knowledgeable and not strict with grades. she is very strict on attendance though","she is not mean she is just kind of awkward about personal interactions but what do you expect from an academic","Dr. Eble is a really good professor! All of you guys complaining about attendance umm.. welcome to college! She is very smart and very thorough but not unfair. A lot of people get the impression that her class will be easy and get upset when it isn't a walk in the park. You have to work because she wants you to learn!","She talks a mile/min, the class lectures were jumbled and difficult to make sense of & she's a very demanding professor. However, she's also sensitive, and once started crying in class because some students didn't turn a paper in.. she talked about how personally she took it. Bizarre.","I had Dr. Eble for graduate Old English 20 years ago and want to respond to a couple of raters: she is a linguist, and a well-regarded one at that and she does know what she's talking about.  She was tough, but quite helpful and sat in on my diss defense at the last minute with some great suggestions.","She reminds me of a high school teacher who has been teaching wayyyy too long! Class content can be interesting at times, but overall drab. She has no pity on missing class (especially daily quizzes).  Essays were difficult to write and she was picky on answers for exams.  Text and outside readings were boring and sometimes difficult","I took a first year seminar with Ms. Eble and LOVED it. The way she pays attention to details will help make your writing more clear and precise. She will make you a better writer.","Very interesting and engaging class, and she seemed to genuinely care about her students.","Eble can be tough and she grades quite strictly. Overall though I think she's a good teacher.","Do everything you can to avoid Eble's classes. She is so nit-picky about little details, can't look at the larger picture, and refuses to compliment any of her students. She'll make you feel stupid and waste 3 hours of your time every week. In now way will she nurture your interest in English.","About 18 years ago, I took Dr. Eble's Modern Grammar class, and I'm still smarting from it.  Once, I came to her office to ask about the term paper (topic:  &quot;write 20 pgs. on anything that is grammatically interesting&quot;).  She was so cold and hostile. If you weren't familiar with 1960s songs that comprised her tests, you were sunk too. Be warned.","This class was extremely tedious.  She insists on going through every little point as if the entire class is incapable of understanding anything on our own.  I could have skipped about half the classes, but she's insane about attendance."],"courses":["ENGL315","ENGL75","ENG313","ENGL314","ENGL314","ENGL75","ENGL313","ENG36","ENGL313","ENGL314","ENGL314","ENGL313","ENG719","ENGL314","ENGL075","ENGL314","ENGL314","ENGL075","ENGL136","ENG314"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":313,"section":990,"class_nbr":12001,"title":"GRAMMAR OF CURRENT ENGL","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":4,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
