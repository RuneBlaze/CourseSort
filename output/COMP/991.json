If you went to office hours he would only help you if you already understood the topic, otherwise he would tell you to come back when you understood the topic.  Assignments weren't bad, but the final was awful.  Had an A until the final.","Disliked his teaching style. His class was a mess; he tried flipped classroom, then went to lectures. Doesn't listen to student suggestions. Boring lecturer. Weekly assignments are tough and take a lot of time. Didn't have prior Java experience and would have failed if not for the friends I had made in the class. Not terrible but avoid if possible.","Attempted to do a flipped classroom style only to have the entire class dislike, switched back to lecture style midway through semester but his lectures left much to be desired and did not explain concepts well.","The class was quite difficult, expecting many hours to be spent on weekly projects which will make up a lot of your grade. The directions and documentation for how to accomplish said projects is often sparse or unclear, adding more hours to what you will spend. It is fun to figure them out, but the class is confusing and time consuming.","Organized in terrible manner, doesn't actually teach concepts while he expects you to know them for assignments","If you don't have a programming background this class is just one large, unclear mess. I enjoy the programming I have done up until this point (a class or two in high school and COMP 110) but the instructions, lectures and the like for this class are so confusing I considered switching majors. I learned the stuff from friends, not from Dewan at all","I had minimal exposure to Java before I started his class. But he was really understanding and helpful. All of his lectures were PPT recorded, which made it easy to recollect. Although some of his assuignment were incredibily long and took hours to complete, it was worth it.","Lectures are recorded and sync'd with PPT slides. If you miss a lecture you can review easily. Very energetic professor, active on the \"piazza\" online forum. I had a background in Java prior to this class, but if I didn't I think the lectures would have been rough.  The recitations are ineffective, but mandatory.","Lectures are recorded and sync'd with PPT slides. If you miss a lecture you can review easily. Very energetic professor, active on the \"piazza\" online forum. I had a background in Java prior to this class, but if I didn't I think the lectures would have been \"death-by-powerpoint\".  The recitations are mostly useless, but mandatory.","Professor Dewan is one of my favorite lecturers in the department. He is clear, concise, and teaches proper programming style. He posts all his PowerPoints online with voice recordings and we had no final - only 2 midterms. The class is not easy though, especially if you have little programming background."],"courses":["COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
