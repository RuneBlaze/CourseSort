She's young and so comes off as pretty chill and approachable. Her lectures are clear and precise, not too much reading. Some group work in class but not too bad, a few short homework assignments but all easily done the night before. She is particular about grading  - she knows what she wants to see  and looks for it."],"courses":["COMM170"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
