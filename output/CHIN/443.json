She really does care for her students, and I would highly recommend taking a course with her.","Love her! She is the reason why I want to pursue through level 300 in Chinese. Amazing professor! Funny, caring and gives many quizzes, but they are to review the material before class. TAKE CHIN 101 WITH HER!","LOVE Zhou Laoshi! She's the best 101 teacher- very understanding, not strict at all, very encouraging. The cutest prof you'll ever have. Explanations can be unclear so ASK if you're confused. ALWAYS speak with tones bc she won't tell you how stupid you sound w/o them. Semester's almost over, 95% sure I'm getting an A, but I knew some cantonese.","Zhou Laoshi is a kind, sweet woman who knows how to teach. She is very patient and clear about most everything. She is also very approachable and will not hesitate to work with you in her office hours should you have trouble with anything.","She gives a lot of tests, but is a great teacher, and made me want to minor in Chinese!  Expect a LOT of quizzes and tests, but I prefer this way, over giving just 2 tests or quizzes throughout the semester, because you do not fall behind, and you really learn the material!  I would ABSOLUTELY take her class again!","Professor Zhou is awesome. She is great at what she does; her jokes are funny and appropriate. She is also very interested in learning about American culture and slang from her students.  The class is easy ONLY if you put the work into it; otherwise you will struggle to keep up and have a hard time answering questions in class.","SUCH A GREAT PROFESSOR. Zhou Laoshi makes learning Chinese interesting and accessible. She invests time in her students and really cares. Although it's sometimes difficult to understand what she's saying at first, you get over it pretty quickly.","Great Teacher!  Very engaging.  She takes great interest in the individual students' lives, interests, and progress.","Zhou Laoshi is such a fantastic teacher, I wish I could take all my future Chinese classes with her. very fair, very light-hearted, and has a very efficient teaching style.  If you keep up with the assignments and pay attention she makes Chinese (kind of) easy, haha.  Highly recommend.","Zhou Laoshi was a great teacher! This was my second semester of Chinese, and she taught with flawless methods! Great at interaction; she doesn't embarrass you if you get it wrong. Mostly asks for volunteers. I truly respect her and appreciated her enthusiasm for this class! Take Chinese!","shes hilarious and has a great structure to class - which i wouldnt have noticed if it wasnt so steady. She also condenses the information so you get a lesson's worth of notes in a few lines. again - hilarious"],"courses":["CHIN443","CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN306","CHIN101","CHIN102","CHIN001"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
