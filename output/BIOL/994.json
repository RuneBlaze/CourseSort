He does tend to get on tangents but is overall a great professor.  I always enjoyed his lectures, although they do switch professors half way through the semester for this class which was kind of annoying.","VERY passionate about his subject, and he knows his stuff. I'm not going to lie, he does go on tangents and it's a little fuzzy until he gets to his main point. However, he's very knowledgeable and makes an 8 am genetics class worth it. He's bad about answering emails though... and his second exam was a lot tougher than the first. Very nice man!","Hard class. Make sure you get the assigned readings done and pay attention to details he not only makes his exams from lecture but a lot of it comes from the readings. Hard exams.","He was obviously very knowledgeable but not able to communicate ideas to the class.  He jumped from subject to subject during lecture so it was hard to follow and take notes.  His tests were hard, but if you paid attention in class, read the textbook, and reviewed masteringgenetics, they were fair.","He liked what he taught but was very disorganized. He's one of those professors that's definitely a great researcher, but NOT a good at teaching. He assumes that you know about a LOT of things beforehand. The exams were extremely ambiguous and hard, especially the 1st one. Also, he never showed up to class on the days we had exams. NEVER.","He is a nice guy and means well and is very passionate about what he teaches. That being said he is very tangential in his lectures and kind of disorganized, so it ends up being quite confusing. Exams are crazy hard, i know many classmates that thought they had a firm grasp on the material that ended up nearly failing the tests.","He introduces an idea, goes to something else, then comes back to finish his point; the end result is sometimes confusing. Not very personable and his test questions are left fielders (even for me and I had a solid A), be ready for curve balls! But, he knows his stuff big time. Minus a couple of nasty test questions, exams are actually very fair.","Dr. Bloom is disorganized, does not explain concepts well, bounces to another concept without thoroughly explaining the first one.  He writes confusing tests and does not clearly express how he would like the questions to be answered.  Biology is a culture and he doesn't do a very good job in helping students integrate into that culture. Avoid him!","Bloom is not a good teacher. He rambles, and refuses to use any kind of technology to teach except Lego blocks (yeah, you read correctly!) and an overhead projector--he seems quite proud of this, too. Tests are somewhat hard, especially the first one. Do yourself a favor and take the other section of this clas.","I enjoyed Dr. Bloom's lectures much better than Dr. Dangl's.  Bloom went slowly through the more complicated material, which was very helpful.  I wouldn't recommend taking this class because as a pair, Bloom and Dangl make this class very difficult to understand","I'm a double science major and Bloom's class was by far my easiest science class at UNC.  He teaches the complicated parts patiently and the practice tests he gives are very helpful.  Do the practice tests and go to review sessions and this class is no problem.","The material isn't easy, but he's very approchable for questions after class.","I did not think either Kerry Bloom or Jeff Dangl were effective teachers. This class contains difficult material and I would advise taking it with someone else.","Somewhat scatterbrained, but generally a good teacher. Stops frequently for questions and goes slowly through difficult material, very much unlike his colleague (and co-professor) Jeff Dangl. Average-difficulty or difficult tests.

He tries his best to be helpful and make the class interesting and overall is not a bad professor. The class is tough but the exams are not impossible and the curve is usually pretty good.","Umbanhowar's lectures are worthless. He stands up there and discusses vague examples and graphs, and doesn't have a clear point. It's better to just read the textbook to understand the material. The tests aren't too hard and are curved ALOT because everyone does poorly. I would stay away from him and his poor ecology teachings.","Absolutely terrible.  Lectures made 0 sense. The recitations are the only thing that  saved me from failing","Terrible.  Not even worth going to class.  I started reading the book before the class lectures and I started to think I could have taught the class better than he did.  He stutters a lot and spends the vast majority of the time talking about simple concepts and completely avoids the nitty-gritty details.  I also hated his voice.","Here's the deal: any class you take with this man will most likely end up in you getting a low grade UNLESS you have the initiative to read the book and study a LOT. The recitation section was helpful, but the professor himself is worthless. He jumps around in his lectures, he is hard to follow, and his exams are hard. Just saying' good luck.","Terrible professor, I could barely understand what he was saying because he mumbles and corrects himself so much. Regularly cancelled office hours and did not seem invested in teaching.","Avoid! He mumbles and has no clue what he is saying half the time. His drawing and diagrams are completely useless.

I enjoyed the class, and the outlines were helpful, but we never really finished them during class. Also there were optional book readings that I found to be completely unnecessary, and oftentimes what was said in the book was never actually tested on. Her office hours are very helpful!","Dr. Burch was just not very good, and she was boring for the most part. You have outlines to fill out, but she doesn't time her lectures very well and you don't have time to finish the outlines. But she still tests you on info from that outline that she didn't even cover. Nice lady but difficult exams and info not presented well","Doesn't finish the lectures or outlines and you are often left having to learn the material for a test without having gone over it in class.","Avoid taking her. Lectures are boring and monotonous. Power points aren't really organized. On her second test she asked loads of questions about the material she barely went over in class. Very bad when it comes to responding the emails. TAs do all the work. Recitations are a total waste of your life.","She sounded kind of out of breath a lot of the times, but she's really not bad.  Definitely a very smart woman and not bad at communicating the ideas she wants you to understand.","She gives you outlines before class so all you have to do is write down minimal notes in class.  The tests weren't really that hard and the material was actually pretty interesting.  The recitation is a little to much work though.","Reasonably good professor but boring and slow-moving at times. Gives relatively easy tests, but requires attendance and participation in recitation, unlike most Bio classes.

He was poorly organized and his slides were difficult to follow. He didn't explain concepts well at all, and sometimes concepts he said wouldn't be on the exam showed up anyways. Did not answer multiple emails. He doesn't seem interested in teaching. Avoid if possible!","Awesome prof! He goes really fast but is willing to slow down if you let him know. There's a lot of info we have to know for the exam, but the midterm wasn't tricky (haven't taken final yet). Only grades are midterm, a project, and a final. Even though he posts the power points on Sakai, you need to go to class in order to do well on the exam","lectures are rambling and pointless, you you'd better go for your poll everywhere grade, which I didn't sometimes and suffered. leaves you with substitutes randomly, who are actually better lecturers. The exams are traps to see if you are an expert in the confusing subject matter. He says it wont cover things we didn't cover, but it's a lie.","Dr. Kieber is the worst professor I have had at UNC. His lectures are boring, he rambles and is super unclear about the material, and he is kind of a smart ass in office hours. He constantly told us in class to not worry about the small details but still tested us on those details. Smart guy but he should stick to research. NOT a good teacher!","I love Kieber. He's very enthusiastic and he makes great lame jokes. His lectures are entertaining. Yeah, he goes fast, but if you take notes and put in some time outside of class you'll be okay. Definitely highly recommend him if you're interested in genetics. I hated Hogan's half (way boring) and loved his.","Dr. Kieber is really smart but you can tell he's a professor because he wants to do research not because he wants to teach. He's kind of awkward and goofy but overall a nice guy. He goes over material quickly so I suggest recording lectures. His tests are really straightforward but not the easiest. Overall not a bad choice for 202.","He's a good professor and an approachable guy.  Study the material from lecture hard and you'll do fine in the class.  Don't worry so much about the textbook; work practice problems from the recitation.","Kieber teaches the second half of Bio 202. He has a lot of energy, however because he must cover such a large amount of material, he is often times VERY unclear about what he's trying to say. Almost to the point of frustration. Be prepared to read the textbook or spend a long time teaching yourself the material. Overall a hard class in general.","first off, the class is curved. the averages for all the exams are generally in the low 60s. without a curve, statistically, the average grade is a D-. That being said its hard to dislike dr. kieber because hes so enthusiastic and is a nice guy overall, but he tries to cover far too much material to be testing on such small details.","YOU NEED TO ATTEND EVERY CLASS!!! otherwise ur gonna regret a lot afterwards b/c the exams are really detailed.personally, had hard time following his lecture. but, some ppl liked his style.","I thought Kieber would be straightfwd, b/c at first he made it clear what was expected.Nice guy, but his teaching style did not work for me.  His combined final with Hogan was VERY DETAILED and cummulative.  I thought for sure teh class would be curved, or the lowest test dropped, but niether happend, and your grade was just your grade.  GOOD LUCK!","HARD class!  I would just avoid it if you can.  I had to email him to ask questions a few times, and he never responded.  He seems like a nice intelligent guy and I'm sure he works for some people, but he moves through the material very quickly.","he's a great professor... you work, but end up KNOWING the material.  he'll also go out of his way to write you a letter of recommendation, if you ask.","HE TALKS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND TALKS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND TALKZZzzzzzzzzzz....

When no one in lecture is able to answer his questions, he doesn't go back over the material, just moves on. When a question is asked in lecture he is even able to explain his answer, just attributes the confusion to a poorly worded question instead.","His lectures are really informative and he is really helpful after class. The exams were tough but I felt prepared by listening to his lectures (the curve helped a lot).","Contrary to the other reviews, I thought Professor Willett clearly defined his expectations. The tests were similar to the practice tests, and his lectures, while a little boring, went into the same level of depth that he expected students to go into on the exam. I never went to office hours, but he seemed nice enough in class.","Dr. Willett seems kind, but he is not a crystal clear lecturer and his expectations are not clearly defined. However, his tests are not terrible. They closely resemble the practice tests he gives students beforehand. Lectures are mandatory for success. Textbook is used lightly, but if you truly want to do well, do all the assigned reading.","Avoid if possible. This guy is condescending and does not care about his students. He makes his tests harder than they need to be, and he focuses on details that are too specific for the amount of material covered. He's a researcher, not a teacher.","NO NO NO NO. His lectures are so boring and so disorganized.  He doesnt fill them in all the way so you have to go sit through his boring class to fill in the definitions and formulas he wants you to know for the test and then the notes are so disorganized you have to go back and reorder them just so you can re-teach yourself the material.
