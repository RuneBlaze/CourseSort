Makes learning Portuguese interesting by telling funny jokes or teaching you Brazilian street slang. Very laid back and always fun to joke around with. Tests are easy and he prepares you well on what to study. One of my favorite professors at UNC.","Professor Vernon is a genuinely nice and relaxed guy, makes learning Portuguese really interesting and certainly thinks outside of the box.","Awesome Professor. I hate taking language classes but I loved his class mostly just because of him. Every day he will make you laugh and is never in a bad mood. Loves to work with his class and is definitely my favorite professor at UNC. Would highly recommend but be prepared to study a fair amount for tests.","Very great 101 professor. He always answered questions. Very laid back. I am grateful for having him as a 101 because I feel as if i learned a lot more from him than from other teachers I heard about. His tests were easy and online assignments weren't checked until the tests. Always looked forward to his class!","Great guy, really funny. You'll learn a lot besides Portuguese from him too.","Great professor, awesome guy, great class. Learned a ton and always looked forward to class!","Very cool, laid back character.  Class tends to be a bit unstructured, but he prepares you well enough for tests.  Vernon is a very approachable guy; he'll answer whatever questions you have to the best of his ability.  One fault: it takes him a while to return tests and compositions.  But he's a fun lecturer so it's a wash.","Great class, great guy! Very funny, made me look forward to this class! Learned a lot too!","Professor Vernon was great and provided interesting comments.  I was afraid of this class before taking it but thankfully he grades fairly and does not provide too much, or too little work.","He is a great guy and the material is interesting if you are a language buff, but he is a bit scatter-brained at times and the class was highly unorganized at first.  Also, it is uspposed to be Brazilian Portuguese but he usually speaks with a Portuguese accent.  Nothing too bad against him, though.","Mr. Vernon is a great teacher.  The class is mainly just reading short stories and then you have daily quizzes on what you read.  The quizzes aren't hard if you do the reading.  The midterms are graded very lentiently.  Overall a very fun class that isn't too difficult and the professor is very funny and not boring at all.","Very nice guy, class material isn't that interesting, but not terrible... recommend knowing some stuff about business first though","Great professors. Exams were very easy and he was always willing to give half credit if you got something wrong but at least knew part it. Would definantly recommend him","A pretty easy, laid back class..a few midterms, which he grades leniently, two short 1-page papers and daily quizzes on the readings. If you're looking for something fun and easy to fulfill that Fine Arts Literature perspective, this is the class."],"courses":["PORT203","PORT101","PORT101","PORT101","PORT203","PORT401","SPAN204","PORT401","SPAN260","PORT401","PORT035","SPAN25","SPAN025","PORT35"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
