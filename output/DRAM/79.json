(This course is the first in the major, I just took it for VP credit). Coming from a math major, sometimes the lectures felt long, but he was really cool and fun to listen to. The homework was very manageable, especially if you have read the plays already.","I had Mark for both 120 and 231 (Playwriting). Easily one of my favorite professors at UNC. Intro classes can easily feel dry with some profs, but put in the effort, and he will teach you a lot. Great guy to know outside of class as well as a theatre practitioner and collaborator.","Mark is not very clear on his expectations for assignments or what he wants for you to be able to receive a good grade. Attendance is mandatory, but the classes do not relate to the work you do out of class. There are only 2 tests, but there is a ton of homework. You do have a week or two to complete all of the assignments, but it is a lot.","Mark is a super cool professor. If your not interested in drama the class can be boring but its worth it because it is so easy. There is a decent amount of work but you have plenty of time to do it. Read the plays and do your play profiles well and an A is completely attainable.","Mark is a great guy and awesome teacher, but he can get off topic easily and often couldn't cover the material in time for exams.","Mark is an awesome guy. Take this class from him and you wont regret it!","Though I wasn't interested in the class prior to taking it, he made it enjoyable. He's very enjoyable and a good teacher.","Perry was a great teacher! I was not looking forward to taking play analysis but he actually made it fairly enjoyable and interesting. There is a lot of homework but it's all due at only three points in the semester so you have a lot of flexibility there. It's a fairly simple class if you go and read the plays.","Perry is a good professor, however, he assigned a ton of &quot;busy&quot; work.  He also makes you read Hamlet in one weekend.  His class is run like a high school course.","I don't know him as a person, I'm sure he's nice, but he's probably one of the dullest professors I've had at UNC. Lectures are excruciatingly boring to sit through and I feel like he's overly dramatic when talking about everything.  Class could be half as long if he just said what he needed to in a timely fashion.","Great professor! I just took this class for the visual arts requirement but he makes it totally interesting and fun. Grading was a little harder than I expected, though.","Mark is a great professor. He actually connects with students and cares about them. His class is engaging, and the material challenges you to think critically, so be ready to work and participate. I highly recommend his class.","Mark rocks! He makes class fun and interesting. You're totally free to speak your mind. The Play Analysis class does have some busy work but it's not hard and is spread out pretty evenly over the semester. Aside from the project, you really only have one or two small things to do per class period. I would recommend Mark for any Drama class!","Mark's a really awesome guy! Take his class if you can. I really liked him :-)","Nicest guy ever, very interesting, very friendly. Got a lot of out his class","No Comments"],"courses":["DRAM120","DRAM120231","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAMA115","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
