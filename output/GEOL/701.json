I couldn't care less about Geology beyond a general interest in science as a layperson, but he made me care, and I learned a lot. He is helpful, clear, brilliant, engaging and fair: if you study his slides, you will pass easily.","I'm not a science major and was pretty uneasy about taking the class at first. But, the material is relatively pretty interesting, gets better over the semester, and you learn a ton. Professor Pavelsky is one of the best I've had at UNC and I would highly recommend the class. He's very enthusiastic and loves helping his students.","Very passionate about his work and it carries over to the class. The class is not unreasonable by any means, and you will surely learn. I would highly recommend it for anyone concerned with Earth's changing climate.","Tamlin's hydroclimatology class was excellent. Inspiring lectures that taught you a lot. Sometimes a little unorganized with his notes but overall straightforward tests and homework. Expects you to be able to read and understand research papers, so this is a fairly upper level class.","I am definitely not a science major and didn't understand a lot of his lectures; however, he is very helpful explaining things one on one.  If it wasn't for his help, I would have never passed the class.","He is always enthusiastic, but he requires a level of work that takes up to 8hrs a week. Don't take this class if you want an easy A, but it is definitely worth what you learn. Can be harsh in grading though.","Lectures are really boring, it's really hard to pay attention in the class but he is really enthusiastic about the subject and if you go to office hours he is very willing to help. His exams are really hard, but his grading isn't too bad.","Really willing to provide extra help, exams are tough and ask for more understanding than memorization. Go to office hours if you find yourself doing poorly; he will tell you what he's looking for in exams. Likes engaging students in the material. Easy to zone out but if you pay attention its super easy to understand everything.","Very enthusiastic about the subject but moves a little slow. A really nice guy though. Subject matter can get boring but you do learn some cool stuff in the class."],"courses":["GEOL109","GEOL109","GEOL109","GEOL508","GEOL109","GEOL483","GEOL109","GEOL109","GEOL211"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
