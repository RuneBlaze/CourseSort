She's understanding and reasonable and will always support you.","This was an excellent introduction to the policy and history behind the U.S. health care system. Simply put, the curriculum and teacher were nonpareil.","This professor does not prepare for class, shows up late for class and keeps students late, assigns excessive/irrelevant readings and does not discuss them, and has certain favorite students but takes pride in belittling other students.

There is a bit of reading and the class begins quickly. Reading though is interesting. Largest challenge is group work. Be sure all group members are clear on expectations. Overall enjoyable class.","Cheryll is the most unhelpful advisor and is demeaning. I would advise if you get assigned to her, please switch to another advisor as soon as possible.","Cheryll is a very educated and passionate person but expects far too much from her distance MPH students.

Guest speakers came in and talked to us every week and it was fascinating to hear them talk about their experiences in public health. If you have an interest in public health be sure to take one of her introductory courses!","I found the class pretty easy. Dr. Yeatts is a great epidemiologist and does a good job of exposing her students to real epidemiology work through class examples and the lab assignments.","Dr. Yeatts is very kind and very intelligent. I thoroughly enjoyed her class. While lectures could seem rather redundant, the lab component of Epid 600 was very useful and interactive. Dr. Yeatts always gave prompt, clear feedback whenever I emailed with a question.
