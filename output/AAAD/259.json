It's obvious he doesn't really care about really teaching the material.","He is a horrible professor! He needs to retire. He flies through the slides so no one can get any notes and he doesn't know how to use Sakai so you can't get them online. He also gets very off topic in class. Also, he doesn't know how email works.","Dr. Hall in my opinion may be one of the most important and currently still teaching minds in the African American  Studies, Social Sciences, Philosophical, Historical, Artistic and overall academic communities of the modern age, in all of higher education. When individuals with his level of knowledge cease to teach it will be a great loss of soul.","He was one of my favorite profs while a student at UNC about 10 years ago. I took 2 of his classes. Cool charisma. Great readings. I was real shy, not a talker in class much, but decided to talk to him after class when I found out he was from Detroit, a city whose music I'm a big fan of. He had a good sense of humor and was real down to earth. Cool","very rude!! his lectures seem pointless and you cant really understand a word he is saying. he has favorites and is very unapproachable. he grades unfair and doesnt answer questions well","Terrible teacher. Classes are extremely boring. For some reason I had a terrible time listening to him. It seems as though he rambles endlessly to himself. There was absolutely no class discussion or student interaction. He does not respond well to questions, especially about tests or quizzes. YOU MUST TAKE GOOD NOTES to do well on tests/quizzes!!!","i wish i woulda figured out his class earlier...for the exams do the review one he gives you and the study questions and master them, ull get a good grade...he is set in his ways so dont even try 2 fight it, its a waste of time...classes are pointless and quizzes are mad anal but all in all tha class was ok","very pretentious"],"courses":["AAAD130","AAAD 130","AFAM059","AFAM49","AFAM102","AFAM102","AFAM102","AFAM70"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE"]}}]
