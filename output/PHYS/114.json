Exams are mostly conceptual so it is important to really understand the material.  The lab is unnecessarily busy with long worksheets but doing well in lab will help your grade.  Don't read the book unless you need reinforcement for lecture.","He's not bad at teaching, especially for a physics teacher. But you really have to hit the ground running with this class. The exams show no mercy; you have to know the material extremely well and solve quickly. Most of the studios were long and written in a confusing manner, which sucks because you need to understand them to do well on the tests.","Physics may be a hard class, but he breaks concepts down so that they are easy to understand. Tests are extremely tough when he decides to change it up. Studios are often long and difficulty depends on how competent your group members are. Overall, he's as good as physics teachers get. His irish cuteness is a plus.","Don't get me wrong--Smith is a helpful and sociable professor. BUT... PHYS 114 is one of the most terribly organized courses I've ever taken. Final exam average: 58. The Mastering assignments had nothing to do with lectures OR exams! Exams were unreasonably tough and always a time crunch. And the studios... long, repetitive, and agonizingly boring.","He creates difficult tests, but they are reasonable, so you have to work hard in the class. Studio matters a lot!! Make sure you understand the concepts before you leave and if you don't go to his great office hours. Also he's super hot, which is an added bonus.","PHYS 114 is a hard class, especially during the summer. But Dr. Smith is a good teacher, and, more importantly, he likes to teach. He's very available for help (lots of office hours), and he'll take the time to offer different explanations. His exams are very tough--they test if you really *understand* the material. Also has a cool Irish accent.","Class is fair, obviously physics is going to be hard, but I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable workload and Dr. Smith's helpfulness. Tests are definitely tough, mostly due to not having enough time to really thing about the questions, but are not impossible to do well on.","At the beginning, this class seemed to be an insurmountable challenge, but after going to office hours and spending a lot of time actually reading the textbook and doing practice problems, it got a lot better. Dr. Smith is a reasonable professor, and he's also willing to help you with anything you don't understand!","Physics is hard, and generally sucks, but Dr. Smith is the best professor for it.  His lectures are clear, and he is always willing to help.  If you do the practice problems, go to class, and go to office hours when you have questions, you'll be fine.  If you put the effort in, you'll get a lot out of this class.","It is necessary to remember physics sucks. Smith makes it suck the least. He is constantly available to help (has Skype), goes at a reasonable pace, and seems delighted to teach physics. Do the practice problems and go to office hours, and you should be fine. Wonderful, nice guy. Highly recommended for any poor sap who has to take physics at UNC.","Professor Smith is a very engaging and helpful professor, I loved having him. His lectures are easy to pay attention to and to follow, and he really makes an effort to check in with the class' progress and help everyone succeed. His tests were hard, but physics is a hard subject. If you have to/want to take physics, take it with Prof. Smith!!! :)","Besides David Jones, the worst professor I've had at UNC.

He works to make himself available to all students via office hours and review sessions. He even offered to Skype me once to provide help on homework. Although this course is challenging and is still transitioning from PHYS 104, Dr. Smith made it enjoyable for me.","Tough introductory class but the professor cares about whether or not his students grasp the material.  Exams are mostly conceptual so it is important to really understand the material.  The lab is unnecessarily busy with long worksheets but doing well in lab will help your grade.  Don't read the book unless you need reinforcement for lecture.","He's not bad at teaching, especially for a physics teacher. But you really have to hit the ground running with this class. The exams show no mercy; you have to know the material extremely well and solve quickly. Most of the studios were long and written in a confusing manner, which sucks because you need to understand them to do well on the tests.","Physics may be a hard class, but he breaks concepts down so that they are easy to understand. Tests are extremely tough when he decides to change it up. Studios are often long and difficulty depends on how competent your group members are. Overall, he's as good as physics teachers get. His irish cuteness is a plus.","Don't get me wrong--Smith is a helpful and sociable professor. BUT... PHYS 114 is one of the most terribly organized courses I've ever taken. Final exam average: 58. The Mastering assignments had nothing to do with lectures OR exams! Exams were unreasonably tough and always a time crunch. And the studios... long, repetitive, and agonizingly boring.","He creates difficult tests, but they are reasonable, so you have to work hard in the class. Studio matters a lot!! Make sure you understand the concepts before you leave and if you don't go to his great office hours. Also he's super hot, which is an added bonus.","PHYS 114 is a hard class, especially during the summer. But Dr. Smith is a good teacher, and, more importantly, he likes to teach. He's very available for help (lots of office hours), and he'll take the time to offer different explanations. His exams are very tough--they test if you really *understand* the material. Also has a cool Irish accent.","Class is fair, obviously physics is going to be hard, but I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable workload and Dr. Smith's helpfulness. Tests are definitely tough, mostly due to not having enough time to really thing about the questions, but are not impossible to do well on.","At the beginning, this class seemed to be an insurmountable challenge, but after going to office hours and spending a lot of time actually reading the textbook and doing practice problems, it got a lot better. Dr. Smith is a reasonable professor, and he's also willing to help you with anything you don't understand!","Physics is hard, and generally sucks, but Dr. Smith is the best professor for it.  His lectures are clear, and he is always willing to help.  If you do the practice problems, go to class, and go to office hours when you have questions, you'll be fine.  If you put the effort in, you'll get a lot out of this class.","It is necessary to remember physics sucks. Smith makes it suck the least. He is constantly available to help (has Skype), goes at a reasonable pace, and seems delighted to teach physics. Do the practice problems and go to office hours, and you should be fine. Wonderful, nice guy. Highly recommended for any poor sap who has to take physics at UNC.","Professor Smith is a very engaging and helpful professor, I loved having him. His lectures are easy to pay attention to and to follow, and he really makes an effort to check in with the class' progress and help everyone succeed.
