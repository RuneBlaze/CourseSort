He's a brilliant man and a great talker without being incomprehensible or condescending. Hope to have him again!","Good class :) He is ridiculously intelligent... could be the smartest person I've ever met. Uses lots of big words but not incomprehensible by any means. I enjoyed this class; great course structure and good book and movie choices for the most part :)","BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. It's not suggested for the anti-intellectuals, but for anyone interested in quality film, it's a must. Ross is extremely passionate about film and is one of the most scholarly yet easy-going people I know. If you're reading the other comments, don't heed them unless you exclusively watch mindless blockbusters.","I took this film class because I thought it would be fun...BIG mistake! Most of the movies are incredibly long and hard to follow. It didn't turn out quite as hard as I thought, but the lectures are extremely boring, be prepared to zone out for the entire class.","He is really passionate about the literature, but his voice is rather monotonous. He doesn't really encourage class discussion, but his lectures are pretty good - if you can stay awake for them. Grading is not too harsh, but he expects a lot.","David Ross is a very smart guy. But his interest was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey(old edition). It was horrible. However I ended up getting a B out of the class with numerous visits at the writing center and his office. Make sure u get plenty of sleep before coming to his class because he can be boring!","Don't take this class unless you REALLY love sci-fi.  The work load is really heavy...about ten books and four movies to watch outside of class.  The exams don't really count, just the papers, so as long as you're a good writer, you'll probably do okay.  But David wasn't helpful at all, so be prepared.","Professor Ross is excellent. He is absolutely brilliant, offers excellent insights on the works we read, and I sincerely recommend anyone take him. One of the smartest professors I've ever had, and overall a very fair grader.","spare yourself the pain of taking his class.  He is VERY BORING and it is annoying to listen to his monotone voice.  You watch several sci-fi films and write 3 papers and a few feeders.  The work isnt hard, but the time spent in class goes by painfully slow.  he put me to sleep in every class.  try another english teacher, there has to be better","Dr. Ross is a wonderful professor. His insights into Romanticism are fascinating and I thoroughly enjoyed going to his class. If you are a dorky English major like me, you will really enjoy this class and Dr. Ross as a person. Very nice man, very helpful. Two 8-12 page papers, and a final exam with 50 multiple choice and two short take home essays.","B-O-R-I-N-G. Although Eng12 isn't supposed to be fun. The class was easy, he was just a very boring teacher. He doesn't really answer questions so much as talk about himself. He likes to slip in comments about The New Yorker at least once a week, which is extremely annoying."],"courses":["ENGL105","ENGL146","ENGL105","ENGL143","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL132","ENGL124","ENGL143","ENGL143","ENGL121","ENGL101","ENGL146","ENG146","ENGL101","ENGL437","ENG12"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":691,"section":12,"class_nbr":11665,"title":"ENGL SR HNRS, PT 1","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"FLAXMAN,GREGORY M","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":691,"section":14,"class_nbr":11667,"title":"ENGL SR HNRS, PT 1","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"KOELB,JANICE H","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":691,"section":11,"class_nbr":9799,"title":"ENGL SR HNRS, PT 1","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"WOLFE,JESSICA L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=619082","fname":"Jessica","lname":"Wolfe","quality":"4.5","easiness":"2.9","help":"2.9","clarity":"2.9","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"2.9","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["Dr. Wolfe is really great! Knows her stuff, and is super passionate about it. ENGL 120 has some pretty dry material, but she makes it bearable. Super understanding of how busy our schedules can be, and is always willing to meet and go above and beyond to help you.","Take a class with her! She is one of the best professors I have had at UNC, and is both a true scholar and a dedicated, kind person who cares about students.  She's willing to meet & edit your papers all of the time, and has even told us that she grades all of the papers in her lectures. Very passionate about literature and helps you dive into it.","A fantastic professor that is an expert on her subject. She will keep you engaged and passionate about her class. I strongly recommend that you fight to get into a small, honors class with her, because she will edit all papers and meet anytime.  I would recommend her to anyone, and you should take multiple classes with her because she gives recs.","Dr. Wolfe is absolutely brilliant and one of my favorite professors at UNC. I knew very little about the topic of classical poetry before taking her class and now I have several new favorite authors and topics. She is sure to keep you engaged, expose new interests, and help you dive into the ancient texts. Have fun!","Absolutely brilliant professor. So knowledgeable and always gives very interesting lectures. Class had 3 essays and an essay-based final, so very writing intensive. She is very accessible and helpful with these papers. Overall, a must have professor at least once.","Professor Wolfe is such an interesting professor. She really knows her stuff and I learned a ton from her class. Lectures are very interesting, though recitation kind of sucks. She grades papers pretty critically, but if you take time on it you can get a B easy. Final was a take home paper, which is great. Overall, great experience.","Jessica Wolfe is one of the best professors for comparative literature/english at UNC. Her teaching style is pretty unique (she speaks really fast!) but its not unfollowable. Keep up with the reading and you should be fine.","Professor Wolfe was very enthusiastic and occasionally humorous. During the last lecture, she said the material wouldn't appear on the final exam, and she joked, &quot;This is the part where half of the class is supposed to leave,&quot; but everyone stayed. The text was difficult to understand, but she clarifies the text in class. Beware: She does talk fast.","I really just can't say enough good things about Jessica Wolfe. She honestly opened my mind to an entire genre -- I used to find classic, epic literature dry and dull, and she revealed the complexity in each novel. What a great professor! So smart, approachable and cool. Can I be her when I grow up&#63;","Dr. Wolfe is by far one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is a brilliant lecturer and extremely helpful outside of class. Her grading is rough but she makes it so easy to do well by providing so much extra assistance and AMAZINGLY INSIGHTFUL lectures. She talks insanely fast and not a minute of time is wasted but it's all worthwhile. =)","Absolutely brilliant, enthusiastic about what she teaches, engaging and exciting at the same time that she blows your mind with her insights. She goes WAY out of her way to meet with you outside of class. Grades tough but fair, reading is very light (and not even necessary if you pay attention). Serious business, but so nice! A must-take teacher!","No Comments","She's a wolfe in sheep's clothing! Yeah, she looks small and meek, and young for a tenured professor, but this woman really knows her stuff, especially Shakespeare. The only complaint I have is that she doesn't lecture much but spends most of her time on class discussion. Still, one of the best English profs you can get.","She doesn't waste a second of class and flies through her lectures, and she's no pushover.  The final was difficult and she required two long papers.

He doesn't offer any meaningful insight or analysis but relies on slow, soft-headed class discussion. Classes are tedious and fruitless. Compares unfavorably to most instructors. An unreasonably tough grader for the low quality of the course.","The novels he picks are interesting, but his discussions aren't. It's nice that he truly wants feedback from students. Unfortunately, the class time felt like a caricature of an English class: a lot of his analysis didn't match the text. On top of that, he grades harshly. A B is doable, but don't expect to be engaged during class.","Dr. Taylor was an amazing professor: he gave great lectures, chose awesome novels, and was all-around funny, nice, and inspiring. Really willing to helptalk about assignments. He's a tough grader, I'm not going to lie, but you really grow as a writer and critical thinker. I've learned to look at literature in a totally new way thanks to him!","Good professor. Takes the material and papers very seriously. Easier to talk to 1 on 1 than you might imagine. He is kind and fair. Do the readings, though- he likes to give 'pop quizzes' on the material that make it really obvious if you haven't done the reading. Proofread your essays carefully!","He values students' feedback and is a very insightful prof. He's fun and engaging, but take the papers seriously, they're no joke! His Popular Genres class is especially great, we read detective novels, sci-fi, and Batman among other texts covered in this course. I also took American lit with him which was just as good.","He's a great professor; he strikes a good balance between productive class discussion and a little lecturing when we needed it. He provides lots of feedback and grades fairly. He's approachable and knowledgeable. Highly recommend!","I really loved taking a class with Prof. Taylor; he teaches the American Novel as a popular genres course, which most professors do not do. He brings up interesting discussions and leads class well. He's a very tough grader though, so run ideas for papers by him before writing them"],"courses":["ENG347","ENGL347","ENGL347","ENGL89","ENGL347344","ENGL261","ENGL347"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":691,"section":16,"class_nbr":11669,"title":"ENGL SR HNRS, PT 1","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"THOMPSON,JAMES P","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=210994","fname":"James","lname":"Thompson","quality":"3.9","easiness":"1.5","help":"1.5","clarity":"1.5","topTag":"","grade":"1.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["The class was pretty easy.
