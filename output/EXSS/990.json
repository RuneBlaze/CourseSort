Consistently, his exam questions had incorrect answers which I pointed out and they were not corrected. Quite frankly, I feel as if I answer a question correctly, I should get the points! Mr. Hanson does not, wish I had more room to elaborate.","Did not enjoy this class. The professor did not keep me engaged at all. Although he made the PowerPoints available, they were not very clear. Therefore, when we had take home tests I sometimes did even worse on them than the in class tests. There were a total of 6 tests, which was nice because each test did not have a large chunk of material.","Extremely unclear lecturer. He does not explain topics well at all, which screws you over for tests.","Reading the textbook is necessary to do well in this class since he makes many topics unclear. He also often takes a while to respond to emails.","Professor Hanson has trouble conveying the concepts to students. This is clear on many exams, where the language and answer choices that Professor Hanson uses confuses many students. Professor Hanson made this class harder and more confusing than it should be."],"courses":["EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","POOR"]}},{"subject":"EXSS","catalog_nbr":990,"section":21,"class_nbr":11132,"title":"RESEARCH IN EXSS","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"HACKNEY,ANTHONY C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1450639","fname":"Anthony","lname":"Hackney","quality":"2.1","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"LECTURE HEAVY (1)","grade":"3.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Dr. Hackney is really not all that bad. He can be snarky at times in class, but he paces the content well for his students. Eight exams seems overbearing at the start. But it has not been too bad, and most of them were online and out of class, so you had flexibility there.  Really nothing too bad, but working very hard is necessary for an A.","Dr. Hackney is seriously the most inequitable man here at UNC. His tests were extremely unfair. The TAs in the class even would say \"It's not in the book, it wasn't on the lecture slides but I'm pretty sure he talked about this in class\" to which we all disagreed on. There are also 7 exams and a final, which makes for an extremely stressful class.","Nice","I do not like him","This dude's a hack. He's super anal about you using your phone in class and is exceptionally boring, making paying attention nearly impossible. On the last day of class, on the power point he uploaded for notes, he replaced certain slides with, \"Slide content presented in class.\" Avoid this professor if at all possible."],"courses":["EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}}]
