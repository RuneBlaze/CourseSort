I am so mad at Prof. Hogan right now, I could spit nails.  So let me end by saying that Prof. Brian P Hogan and his countless imitators are unremittingly hostile towards those of us who  proportion all associated efforts to the exigency of the times.","Biochem with Hogan is not your typical run-of-the-mill premed class. No tests, no cutthroat pressure, and no boring lectures. Classes are very interactive (although at times unfocused), but Hogan really increases your affinity towards a subject as intimidating as biochem. Lots of self-study and reading primary research articles, though.","Brian Hogan is the best professor in all of the chem department. Take his class.","Great Professor! He really knows his stuff and presents it in a clear and comical way. The key exams are the first and final. They are the easiest. I'm thinking he pulled the second exam from a neurological biochemisty textbook. The third exam was fair but not as easy as the first and final. Overall, I really enjoyed him.","Love this guy. I don't like chem, only took it b/c of bio major, but Hogan makes it bearable. He's SO funny, down-to-earth, & understanding. Had class at 8am, not a morning person at all, & STILL found him engaging! His tests are fair, just do what you're supposed to and you'll be fine. Read the book & do the practice problems, simple as that.","Where is your Tanner Award&#63; Remember, &quot;on average we're all average in our own special way&quot;","Seems really cool but is actually pretty cocky. Kept lectures interesting for an 8 AM. Read the book and do the practice exams!","Great Professor, very funny! Learned a lot from the class. Requires intense studying, exasm are fair, but super tricky. Over all, great class, will take another chem class with him any day.","Wonderful!! Read the book and work the problems, but if you do that, tests are a piece of cake. Got a 100 on the first one!","Awesome!! Great teacher. Tests not that hard, but you must work problems in the book. Don't let basic notes fool you. You need to read the book and work the problems to do well on the tests, but no trick problems on the test. Love him!!","The exams aren't *that* hard.  His pedagogy is fantastic, and making the most of your time in class will save you hours of study time.  If you're a strong student, don't listen to him when he says to take 'fru-fru' courses with this--I took this concurrent with Physics 116 over the summer, and did well in both, so it's not impossible.","LOVE him, LOATHE his exams. They're not impossible, they're just very challenging. He's a very smart guy and funny too, I'd marry him :) if he weren't already married...boo :(","Hogan is a great professor. Very interesting and very humorous. All though his tests are pretty self-explanatory make sure you work some problems out of the book in preparation for his tests. He doesn't go into too much detail but kinda just touch basis with it","Great Professor!!!!!  He is a great speaker and explains things really well.  He doesn't curve (at least in my class) but drops the lowest test grade.  I would suggest Hogan over any other chem 102 professors.  Do the practice problems to do well on the tests.","I am a Duke student who took this class at UNC (because it isn't offered at Duke in the spring). I have to say, I'm very jealous of the tarheels. If all profs at UNC are as awesome as this one, then I think I might have gone to the wrong school. Hogan's tough but totally fair and you LEARN SO MUCH from him. He makes biochem relatable.","Astounding professor for a space alien. You'd never guess he's actually a shapeshifting extragalactic killing machine. Lectures are very comprehensive, but I never figured out what enslaving whole solar systems had to do with biochemistry. Maybe that's why I got a Z in his class, whatever that means. He melts if you put hot sauce on him.","Only prof to say anything heart felt about the Eve Carson situation.  Read a beautiful poem to the class.  You may not like the class, but you have to like his humanity.","Nice guy. It is hard to have Chem only twice a week w/ longer class periods at 8AM. I always dozed off. No way were Hogan's kids worked as hard as those in Chamberlin's 101 class, that's for sure! An A in this class no way compares to her As. You're going to be in for a shock going from Hogan's mc tests to written tests in most other Chem classes.","I am not a Chemistry major, and didn't need the class to fulfill any requirements. I took it because I had a mild interest in Chemistry. I am really glad Dr. Hogan was my prof. He was a very fair prof, who somehow managed to show he cared, even in a class with 400+ students. Very clear, funny, intelligent. His tests are moderate, but not tricky.","Dr. Hogan is insane.  How can a man be so enthusiastic about chemistry at 8am!  He's funny and actually seems to know students names.  He is very clear in class, but the exams are more difficult than the assigned problems.  His personality and jokes make waking up at 8 worth it!"],"courses":["CHEM430","CHEM430H","CHEM430","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM430","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM430","CHEM430","CHEM102","CHEM102","CHEM430","CHEM530L","CHEM430","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
