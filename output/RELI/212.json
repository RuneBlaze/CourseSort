The textbook for this class also sucks.","Dr. Lam was okay. The class was interesting over all and the articles pretty cool but would sometimes be very long. Lam was very engaged in the material and enthusiastic during lectures, but there was no over all theme or direction for the readings. He's a nice, helpful guy but a tough grader and doesn't make grading criteria clear to begin with.","Topics covered on the exams seem pretty random. The study guides he gives are less than worthless; mercifully, he grades the exams pretty lightly. He's harsher on the essays, but he leaves useful comments overall. In-class, he's enthusiastic and clearly knowledgable but a rambler, and his lectures jump around from topic to topic inelegantly.","This class was supposed to be about religion in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. However, half the class was spent discussing obscure history. All the vocab is random and every question gets answered in a long ramble just to say nothing helpful. I emailed him to ask what to study and he sent an essay-long response just to say \"study everything\".","This class was so frustrating. Course description very misleading. Sole focus was grammar and language. Lam was condescending and unhelpful in group setting, and unwilling to adjust his expectations even when people struggled. Is a LANGUAGE course, any claims otherwise are ridiculous. Would not recommend for a senior just trying to fulfill geneds!!","Classwork unrelated to course description. Graded hard. Not understanding. Not worth it to fulfill Gen Eds. Boring, long-winded lectures, rambled, sarcastic when answering questions. Knew his stuff but it seemed that he didn't realize that the majority of the class were not reli majors and were in the class for interest or gen ed requirements.","I found the material interesting, but I found his lectures relatively unhelpful. He clearly knows his stuff and is very intelligent, and he's nice enough, but I didn't think he was very good at communicating the concepts clearly. He beats around the bush a lot and it takes him forever to get to the point, which made him hard to listen to.","Lam knows his stuff and this class is sort of intimidating, but he and the TA grade easily and I made an A-. Lectures are interesting and clear","Excellent teacher, very knowledgeable and helpful. His enthusiasm and energy is contagious. Always ready to answer questions and offer help."],"courses":["REL117","RELI205H","RELI117","REL117","RELI211","RELI211","RELI103","RELI103","RELIG117"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
