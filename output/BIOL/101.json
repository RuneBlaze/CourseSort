Lots of application questions and the homework/GRQ (guided reading questions) and notes are pretty time consuming. You will learn a lot, but theres a good amount of work.","Dr. Hogan was an excellent teacher. I loved her as a person and how she was able to keep Biology exciting and fun. She made the class of over 400 people seem so much smaller by her teaching style. I didn't do very well in her class, unfortunately, because the exams are quite difficult. I would highly recommend this professor though!","Dr. Hogan was one of my favorite professors. She is a great teacher,  and although her tests are difficult, if you study hard you can do well. One thing I loved is that she often reminded us that grades don't define us and that there's more to life that school.","Awesome professor, but a challenging class nonetheless. Expect a lot of questions that require you to think abstractly and demonstrate mastery.","Dr. Hogan is a great lecturer and really cares to help her students.  Some exams may be tough, and online homework was annoying sometimes, but not too difficult and does help to understand the material.  Just attend class and you will do fine.","Dr. Hogan is super sweet and gives you all the resources she can to help you succeed. Lectures are interesting and she dumbs down the material in class to make sure everyone understands it. However, her tests are much much much more difficult than lectures make you think they will be. Overall, it was a good experience and I learned a lot.","TAKE HOGAN! Lectures are engaging. She's lowkey funny and super chill. Keep up with the readings, its a decent amount, but nothing crazy. There are learning catalytics questions daily for a participation grade. The class moves at a good pace. Tests aren't \"easy\", but if you do the work, you'll be fine. 10/10 would recommend!","Her format for teaching is incredible, and she really gives you all the tools you need to do well. Be prepared to do a lot on your own time, but a great class and professor.","Hogan is an amazing teacher. She is so passionate about science which makes a difficult subject enjoyable. Her lectures are very interesting and engaging. Her tests are very tough, but if you can devote a couple days to studying and keep up with notes and actually read the text you'll do fine. This class really taught me how to study the right way.","Kelly Hogan is outstanding! Her lectures are goal-oriented and in-depth. She deeply cares about her students and the material, listening to feedback and thoroughly reviewing confusing material. Her first two tests were okay, but the third one was difficult for the whole class. The final is rewarding if you keep up with the class.","Hogan is a phenomenal professor. I walked into this class extremely intimated and rightfully so. Hogan will help you no matter what - she is sweet and considerate and so passionate about biology. She really makes you work for your grade, but her class teaches you how to learn and how to study. I would definitely take her again. She's an inspiration","Dr. Hogan makes topics very interesting, she takes times with difficult subjects, she addresses concerns in class, and is very clear. Her tests are VERY hard but you actually learn instead of memorize it, a lot of work is required for this course but i would highly recommend her. She cares about you learning the material.","Dr. Hogan was an amazing professor for Biol 101. She gives adequate time on difficult biology matters and makes sure that she gets through everything she had planned on in the lecture. You have online mastering due twice a week, which some can take 30 minutes, others can take 2 hours. Over all, do the mastering and pay attention and come to class!","Honestly this class was hard if you never took AP Bio. This is where you learn if you were meant to be in the science field or not. She's a great person though! Definitely cares about her students.","As long as you go to class everyday, do all of your online assignments, and go to SI at least once a week you'll definitely get at least a C easily. B if you read your textbook.","Hogan is awesome! She's really nice and is a good resource not only for the biology department but for helping first-years get acquainted to UNC in general. The tests are SUPER hard and cover a lot of material. Make sure you stay on top of all the GRQs and homework so you can do well on the exams. There's 4 exams and she drops the lowest grade.","Hogan assigns a lot of work, but it pays off. It's a little annoying to have to participate so much in a big lecture class where you might rather just sit back and listen, but all of the things she makes you do for participation grade end up really helping you learn. She thinks a lot about how her students will learn best.","Hogan is a great professor assuming your comfortable doing the majority of work outside of class. Lectures are very helpful and extremely engaging. Hogan does her best in making herself available to such a large class.","She's really nice and funny. The lectures are pretty fun. You use your laptop to answer questions during class.","By far my favorite professor at UNC so far.  I was interested in biology already, but she made it very fun, interactive and I actually wanted to do the homework.  She truly cares about her students; when I got an A on a test, she personally emailed me to congratulate and keep up the good work. Her passion and excitement for learning was contagious."],"courses":["BIO101","BIO101","BIO101","BIO101","BIOL101","BIOL101","BIO101","BIO101","BIO101","BIOL202","BIO101","BIO101","BIOL101","BIO101","BIOL101","BIOL101","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL101","BIOL101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":419,"class_nbr":3547,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0208","days":"W","time":"14","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":424,"class_nbr":12384,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0208","days":"Th","time":"09","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":18,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":420,"class_nbr":3548,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0209","days":"W","time":"14","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":24,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":422,"class_nbr":3550,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0208","days":"W","time":"18","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":423,"class_nbr":3551,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0209","days":"W","time":"18","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":425,"class_nbr":3553,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0209","days":"Th","time":"09","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":20,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":426,"class_nbr":3554,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0207","days":"Th","time":"14","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":427,"class_nbr":3555,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0208","days":"Th","time":"14","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":428,"class_nbr":3556,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0209","days":"Th","time":"14","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":429,"class_nbr":7693,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0208","days":"Th","time":"18","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":24,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":101,"section":430,"class_nbr":6801,"title":"INTRO BIOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Coker","room":"0209","days":"Th","time":"18","instructor":"STEGENGA,BARBARA D","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
