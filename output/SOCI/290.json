I absolutely loved her class. The readings are attention grabbing. There are a lot but its nothing that cant be done. The class is worth it I promise. Taking her class has definitely made me more aware of the issues in our society. As long as you do the work you will do fine in the class. One of the best professors I have had so far!","Sherryl is absolutely fantastic. She is so intelligent and you will learn so incredibly much about WMST. This class should be required for all students at UNC. Expect a good amount of reading but nothing ridiculous. Only a midterm and final as far as tests go. Reflection papers once a week and quizzes once a week (not hard I promise) Take it!","Sherryl is fantastic!! She is one of the most enlightening people I've ever met and one of the best professors. Must take. There is a good amount of reading, but it is all worth it. Reflection papers due on Tues and quizzes on Thurs. All easy As. Exam questions given in advance.  Must email to enroll. DO IT"],"courses":["SOCI124","WMST124","SOCI124"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
