He's an academic that you can feel comfortable talking to outside of class. Lectures were a bit loose but the midterm and final were graded very fairly.","terrible class, lectures unclear and all he makes sure hes clear about is voicing his liberal opinions","Hot!","Great teacher who makes the subject interesting.  Provides class slides online, so going along with lectures are relatively easy.  Homework isn't terrible, and the tests are relatively easy so long as you've studied.","WONDEFUL! Makes stats understandable. Is always available and classes are as entertaining as they can be with grad stats. He's also a reallhy nice and funny person.","very nice man...exams and homework are pretty simple but study for his FINAL!!!","nice guy and I miss watching Wallace & Gromit!!"],"courses":["PSYC532H","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYCH210","GRADUATE","PSYC30","PSYC030"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
