The material is really interesting and there's not nearly as much reading as you would expect for this kind of class, though there is a fair bit. His grading is super easy, which is great. The lectures can be kind of long, but again super interesting. I definitely want to take another class with him.","I love Prof. Lesher! He is such a nice guy and he is always there to help you and clarify any material you didn't understand. He grades really fairly and he makes all the material really interesting. I would definitely recommend taking this class!"],"courses":["PHIL210H","PHIL210"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
