She pushes you hard, and makes you defend your point of view, but in her class I became a much stronger writer and critical thinker. Classes like this with professors like her are what college is all about!","Horrible professor. FYS's are supposed to be easier than other classes. Instead, she assigned 2 2-page papers a week, acted like this was the only class her students were taking, and took pride in giving out only 1 A for each assignment. She needs to get over herself.","She is an interesting professor, and she really knows her stuff.  What is really frustrating, however, is the way she grades.  I took her first year seminar expecting it to be an easy A, as all FYSs really should be, but instead I'll be lucky to make a B.","Jackson is an amazing professor. She really knows the information and is passionate about it, so she makes the experience interesting. It's almost fun just watching her teach. The weekly response papers can be difficult, but the grading on those depends on your TA. Jackson herself is great, though. I would definitely recommend her.","She's amazing! Her comments on papers really helped me to improve my writing and find greater meaning in the text.","Thought Jackson was great. She has a fresh perspective on am. history and exposes viewpoints that most teachers wouldnt dare illuminate. Yes there are annoying parts like the section on how to write a good paper, but the focus of the class is not on fact regurgitation but critical thinking, analysis, & questioning what you think you know. Awesome.","No Comments","No Comments","sucks not only as a prof,but as a person as well.my 2nd exam i got a 77 on, went to talk to my ta who told me that &quot;i had every fact on there (essay & IDs), which is why i got *half credit&#63;*&quot; they pull the grades out of their youknowwhats. if you want to learn, try someone else--shes mean, stupid, egotistical, angry, and should not be teaching.","No.  Just no.  Do yourself a favor and take this class with someone else.  (The first day of class she explained how Ronald Reagan was similar to Tim McVeigh)","she's pretty much full of bs, and if you don't agree with her, you. are. wrong.  she assigns readings and papers and talks AT you like its the only class youre taking (what&#63;&#63; you havent done the paper due in a week&#63;! you=bad, baaad person) i dont know what we're doin in this class, and i dont know why i show up every day..."],"courses":["HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST569","HIST89","HIST089","HIST128","HIST569","HIST22","HIST22","HIST22","HIST22","HIST022","HIST22"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
