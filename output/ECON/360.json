The syllabus was constantly not referred to and I felt as thought there was not much background included before we started discussing solutions. More organization would have helped this class a lot.","While the class isn't hard in terms of assignments (actually it's very easy), Professor Shields made the class absolutely unenjoyable. Her lectures are disjointed and the powerpoints only make things more confusing. She isn't a good teacher and I would NOT recommend her for this class. Maybe a class with a specific focus would be better with her.","The worst professor I have had a Carolina. Totally unreasonable in the amount of reading.","I was very disappointed in this class. The lectures were confusing & disjointed, the powerpoints useless, and the essays extremely frustrating bc of the former two. I took this class to get a general basis of knowledge in the Middle East, and that failed miserably. I only recommend this course if you are already well-versed in the region.","This is an amazing class with relatively few papers and midterms that will teach you a lot about the Middle East and give you a new perspective on history. There is a lot of outside reading, but you can get by without it. Weekly news and discussion postings are annoying, but otherwise, it's a fantastic class!","Professor Shields is extremely knowledgeable but kind of mean when it comes to simple questions. Her lectures are hard to follow because her powerpoints are difficult to understand. I love the class, I just wish it were more organized.","She's passionate about history and does a good job of involving even a large lecture hall, but she's somewhat scatterbrained. There is often little cohesiveness between lectures or even within a lecture, which can be very confusing.","This class had the potential of being great, but unfortunately Shields is impossible to follow. Her lectures are beyond unorganized and the power points are useless as well. The readings are long, tedious, and don't apply much to the topics discussed in class. I lost motivation for this class early on...","2 essays, postings and 1 page journal each week, map quiz, 3 events, and 5-6 page final paper. An extra credit paper (4-5 pgs) is allowed. It's possible to get a good grade, but the work is tedious.  Shields knows the subject, but is hard to follow sometimes. However, she gives a very balanced untainted view of history. The TA's grade everything.","Doesn't really know anything about effective teaching.","too many readings that were always too long as well. I'm an english major and I received a lower grade on her papers than on similiar ones for my english classes!","I had her for a seminar about palestine and israel. she gives you the documents, and then lets you decide. Then she will tell you about what happened. She is left wing, but she isnt biased. She can't change history.","Stridently anti-American and anti-Israel.  Do not take her if you want a balanced view of the recent history of the Middle East -- she is completely biased.  Extremely left wing professor.  Unfortunately, she's the only person who teaches Middle East history, so you're stuck with her.","Be warned -- she is a strong and vocal critic of Israel.  Her sympathies are completely pro-Palestinian, and she doesn't try to hide it.  If you support Israel, you will not enjoy her classes."],"courses":["HIST276","HIST276","276","HIST276","HIST276","HIST276","HIST276","HIST276","HIST276","HIST77A","HIST37","HIST","HIST77","HIST"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","POOR"]}}]
