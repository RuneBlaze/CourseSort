Tests are not cumulative and they included multiple choice and true/false questions. You can procrastinate and study 1-2 hours the night before and pull an A. Good filler class.","She is great! So enthusiastic about the class. There is not much work at all other than the tests. They do require studying, but a little studying will go a long way. I took this class because I needed more hours, I would take it again.","Do not take this class if you don't have to. Yes, the topics are easy, but the lectures are the most boring hour of your life. She treats everyone as if they are either going to cheat or are dumb. If she didn't have an attendance policy and you could teach yourself, than I would recommend it.","Prof. Murray is awesome! She is super sweet and enthusiastic about the class.  She posts all of her lectures word for word online which is nice, and the extra assignments are super easy.  She is very strict about attendance though, so don't skip! If you need an elective, take this class.","I'm not sure what the course # is - it's the &quot;easy&quot; one, Personal Health, I think.  It was easier than any class I've ever taken in my life, including elementary school, I'd think.  HUGE drawback - she gave some incorrect information which was gratuitous besides; it seemed to me she had a little anti-abortion agenda.","She's very passionate about health. Easy filler class. She does have a strict attendance policy though. Tests are pretty easy and they are NOT cumultive, which is great. If you just need another class for more hours, definitely take this one."],"courses":["EXSS41","EXSS141","EXSS141","EXSS141","EXSS41","EXSS141"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
