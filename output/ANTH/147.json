Chua really cares about her students and focuses on each student's individual experience in class. Though the material and assignments may sound easy at first, don't slack off. She puts a lot into her teaching and expects a lot from her students.","Wonderful professor and amazing class. One of the best at UNC.","Professor Chua is a fantastic teacher. You should probably attend every class since there is so much material and she does not post notes, but if you do attend class you will understand the material and leave enlightened. Make sure you do the readings- skipping them is ill-advised since they are a big part of the exams.","She is extremely easy to approach in office hours if you have any questions. She is very good at lectures, keeps them interesting. Her power points are very good but she doesn't post them online, so you should go to class. Probably should type your notes/slides to keep up with her lecture speed, which was fast. Plus side, fast lecture=leave early.","Professor Chua is an incredibly nice person, she really encourages class participation and gives great feedback on papers. However, the class itself was extremely challenging. Can be anywhere from 50 to 150 pages of reading each week.  Be prepared to takes LOTS of notes and do ALL of the readings. The final exam is cumulative and miserable!"],"courses":["ANTH325","ANTH325","ANTH147","ANTH147","ANTH325"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
