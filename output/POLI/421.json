There are pop quizzes, but really interesting guest speakers. This class is a bit of a time commitment with the outside lectures, but its worth it. If you get a chance you should definitely tour the prison. If you don't read the books for the class you'll be lost the whole time - they are vital.","VERY INTERESTING! Class is lecture style. He posts the ppts online, but go to class because there are pop quizzes. There are mandatory speaker events every week outside of the class (so it's a big time commitment). There are 2 papers, 1 final, pop quizzes, and recitation grade. Definitely recommend. I learned a lot. Relatively easy to get an A"],"courses":["POLI203","POLI203"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
