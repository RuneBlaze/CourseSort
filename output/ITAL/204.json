She encourages everyone to participate during class. She pretty much tells you what will be on your tests and quizzes, and is very clear in what she expects for an writing done. Would definitely take again.","I don't do well with languages, but she is incredibly supportive and works to help you. She clearly explains the material and provides enough work to solidify it. Her lectures are very clear, and she is a honest but forgiving grader. There was a lot of group interaction. She even graded my final after I finished it so she could go over it with me."],"courses":["ITAL101","ITAL101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
