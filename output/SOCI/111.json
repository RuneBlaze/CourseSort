Tests are definitely not easy A's - there are always random questions that are almost impossible to answer. There is no homework although probably do the readings or else you will not be able to answer many test questions.","His lectures are mega-boring, and put me to sleep almost every time. The tests are straight forward from the lecture power points, and he is a pretty easy grader. Not a hard professor, decently easy class.","This class requires very little work; however, the tests are a little more difficult than expected with a lot of questions drawn from material not in lecture. Not necessarily an easy A.  Lectures are kind of boring, though the information is fairly interesting. Curves the class well.","Awesome class/professor! prof. nielsen is really nice and as long as you do the reading and come to class it's not too difficult. interesting too","Wonderful professor.  Soft-spoken, but very kind and interested in Sociology and the success of his students.  He clearly communicates his expectations, and his lectures are exceptionally organized.","Very nice and accessible. Works to help students learn material, even meet after class. Easy grader. Knows/teaches lots of interesting obscure stuff. His voice might make you sleepy though!","Nielsen is a wonderful teacher. He may not be as vibrant as others, but he is very clear (and provides excellent notes), and shows a lot of interest in his subject and in his students. Great beard too. He's a sweet guy and has a quirky accent. I'd recommend taking his classes.","Dr Nielsen is a really great teacher. His preparation is impeccable.  Many will not appreciate his bone dry European humor, given taht this is UNC and many students are from the countryside of North Carolina. He is also a very generous grader.","This class was horribly boring. And we had to do projects to present to the class--they were graded VERY subjectively. I would not recommend taking this class, even though it's pretty easy.","Prof Nielsen bored me out of my mind. I was originally very interested in sociology, but after taking this class, I will not take another sociology class.","You get half credit for just showing up and taking a quiz. And the questions are really easy. The only assignment is to fill out your family tree. The reading is pretty easy and you don't even really need to read it because the midterm and final are so easy and 95% taken from the notes he goes over in class."],"courses":["SOCI111","SOCI111","SOCI111","SOCI111","SOCI111","SOCI001","SOC111","SOCI230","SOCI250","SOCI111","SOCI11"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SOCI","catalog_nbr":111,"section":2,"class_nbr":10055,"title":"HUMAN SOCIETIES","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Bingham","room":"0103","days":"TuTh","time":"11","instructor":"NIELSEN,FRANCOIS D","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":48,"enrl_tot":47,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=797090","fname":"Francois","lname":"Nielsen","quality":"4.0","easiness":"2.2","help":"2.2","clarity":"2.2","topTag":"LECTURE HEAVY (3)","grade":"2.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER","LECTURE HEAVY","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Very hard to understand and his lectures are extremely boring.
