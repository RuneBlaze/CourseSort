He tells cool anecdotes about the artists to make them memorable and makes you appreciate the music even as a non-music major. There is no homework except for the concert journals and the papers (which are a bit annoying, but still minimal). The listening sections of his exams are difficult so be sure to listen to all the songs","Stephen Anderson is an excellent professor! He makes it clear from the beginning that grades are not what matter most to him - he simply is excited to teach you about jazz, which he is obviously passionate about. He also cares that you do well and enjoy the class. It is easy to get an A in this class, and it's also super enjoyable."],"courses":["MUSC145","MUSC145"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MUSC","catalog_nbr":145,"section":990,"class_nbr":13809,"title":"INTRO TO JAZZ","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"TA","attributes":["VP"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
