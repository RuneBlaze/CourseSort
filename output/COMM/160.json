My class was kind of late, but Eric totally made it worth it. Eric is the kind of professor that I believe every student should have once in their lifetime. He is so inspirational!","Took COMM120 with Sorensen last Spring, he was an awesome professor. Hilarious guy, covers lots of interesting material and gets through the boring stuff quickly. He brings his wife in to lecture at least once and she's just as awesome as he is. The class was easy and enjoyable, definitely recommend taking a course with him!!"],"courses":["COMM120","COMM120"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"COMM","catalog_nbr":160,"section":1,"class_nbr":12495,"title":"INTRO TO PERF STUDIES","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Bingham","room":"0101","days":"TuTh","time":"15","instructor":"POLLOCK,DELLA","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":20,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=566726","fname":"Della","lname":"Pollock","quality":"3.5","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":[],"comments":["one of the most amazing people i've ever met.  i learned a lot about course materials, and i learned a lot about how i want to be in the world.  difficult work made so enjoyable by a talented and committed professor.","Amazing teacher, interesting class.  You get to know your peers very well, and every class was interesting.  She's brilliant.","If you like tear-jerker Lifetime movies, this is the class for you.  If you don't like to tell private secrets for a grade, stay away.","An interesting class and an interesting teacher. If you can examine the emotion of a piece of literature and look at it in an unexpected way (some bullsh*t is extremely helpful) than you'll have a good time. Not difficult grade-wise and lots of fun if you buy into the concept of performance lit."],"courses":["COMM167","COMM60H","COMM212","COMM60"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD"]}}]
