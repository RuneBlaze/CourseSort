As an example, I now have a History minor. You can tell that he really cares and know a lot about the class topic (Black Lives in the 50s). He is kind of a tough essay grader, but if you ask him for help he will definitely give you feedback that will get you a good grade."],"courses":["HIST89"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
