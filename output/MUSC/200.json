Great teacher. Really wants to see all her students succeed. She is very accommodating of students and, as long as you let her know ahead of time, you can miss class occasionally. Her lectures were clear and captivating. All in all, a great teacher, passionate about the subject material.","Dr. Yang is one of the best pianists and professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. She always finds ways to improve your skills as a musician and is there to help you achieve any musical feat you desire. I have seen so much progress  and development in myself as an individual since taking lessons with her."],"courses":["MUSC223","MUSC200"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MUSC","catalog_nbr":200,"section":6,"class_nbr":11447,"title":"ADVANCED KEYBOARD LESSON","component":"Lecture","units":2,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"ANDERSON,STEPHEN R","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":4,"enrl_tot":3,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2082525","fname":"Stephen","lname":"Anderson","quality":"5.0","easiness":"1.0","help":"1.0","clarity":"1.0","topTag":"Clear grading criteria (1)","grade":"1.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["HILARIOUS","CARING"],"comments":["Anderson is the man. He tells cool anecdotes about the artists to make them memorable and makes you appreciate the music even as a non-music major. There is no homework except for the concert journals and the papers (which are a bit annoying, but still minimal). The listening sections of his exams are difficult so be sure to listen to all the songs","Stephen Anderson is an excellent professor! He makes it clear from the beginning that grades are not what matter most to him - he simply is excited to teach you about jazz, which he is obviously passionate about. He also cares that you do well and enjoy the class. It is easy to get an A in this class, and it's also super enjoyable."],"courses":["MUSC145","MUSC145"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
