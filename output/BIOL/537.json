Tests are all free response and ask for incredible amounts of detail. Test averages were in the 50s consistently. Powerpoints do not have all of the information you need to know on them and he goes super fast in lectures. If I could do it again I would avoid him at all costs.","The Biotech FYS is not wonderful, but not horrible or difficult.  There's not much work, and you don't learn all that much.  Dr. Reed is a genuinely nice guy (he had the class over to his house for dinner!) but he's a botanist at heart (not the best as far as social skills go).  Material combines the biotech with the industry entrepreneurship.","As with all bio profs, he should not be teaching.  He belongs in a lab.  Very smart man, but not good at getting his point across.  He loves his projector & his tests are not representative of lecture.  You have to hope for a good TA that can teach u what u need to know.","The man is brilliant, in that 'i dont know how to talk to normal people' kind of way. moves fast, uses images to lecture by so you have to take notes fast on what he's saying. tests are rediculously hard and he likes it that way. averages on tests were in the 50's. Steve Rogers, who taught the first half was a lot better.","Teaches very fast but if you put the time in you can learn the material. This is a teach yourself course. Tests are NOTHING like what is taught. This class will put a major dent in your GPA. He will help in office hours but even with office hours and reading the book tests are EXTREMELY difficult. First test we had the whole class never finished!","Teaches fairly clearly, but tests are not at all representative of what he teaches. Final was almost exclusively over material covered very, very briefly or not at all. Hard to follow sometimes due to halting speech. Not recommended.","He is a very boring teacher and it was a horrible first year seminar. There is hardly any work but it is very boring. He also does not assign any grades, so you have no idea how you are doing in his class until the end."],"courses":["BIOL205","BIOL053","BIOL52","BIOL52","BIO52DEVBIO","BIOL52","BIOL006D"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL"]}}]
