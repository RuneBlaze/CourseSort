He assigned A LOT of problems from the book which weren't graded or anything but they helped tremendously with my understanding of concepts. He also cares a lot about your performance in the classroom -- make sure to take full advantage of his Q/A sessions!","Todd does care about studentS; however, he doesn't care about YOU- a student. He likes to be liked by all, but is short and narcissistic when it's one-on-one. He also expects WAY MORE than a student can do in a semester and still be successful in other classes, but he doesn't care. Many useless book problems. Final was my highest grade. LOW avgs.","Austell is a genuinely nice person that cares about his students. HOWEVER,  he excepts more out of students than is possible. His teaching style is also very odd, in that he briefly goes over concepts and a lot of what you learn is what you teach yourself.","Todd is a great teacher and a very nice guy. All the material he gives is overwhelming at times but if you put in the work you'll be fine. He doesn't give answers to any of his worksheets/review sheets, which is very annoying and my one dislike of the course. If you're willing to put in the work and take learning seriously then I highly recommend.","Really kind, amazing at lecturing, but I feel like he has an approach to learning that is more so focused on the process and less on the product, i.e., your GPA, which isn't necessarily effective. He doesn't post answers to the worksheets or practice tests, and relies on discussion on forums which isn't necessarily a way to gauge your understanding","Great lecturer who is excited about teaching the course, and students grasping the concepts. He produces a lot of additional material that can be overwhelming at times, but it's done with the best intentions of students learning organic chemistry. I highly recommend his course, but beware that lots of time is required to read and work problems.","Todd was probably the best professor I've had at UNC- he truly cares about his students and their success in life. He is constantly sending out reminders and encouraging people to keep up with the material each wee. That being said, the class is tough and he assigns a lot of work; be prepared to apply yourself and don't get behind on the readings.","Todd is the type that believes you don't have other work outside of his class. Of course you need to invest time into chem classes to do well (everyone knows that), but the time he expects you to put in isn't reasonable for anyone that is taking more than 12 hours. Love yourself and take someone else. P.s. he writes his own reviews, so watch out...","Excellent professor! Strongly recommend him.","Austell definitely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. His downside is the sheer volume of work he assigns, as well as the difficulty of his test. To do everything that was assigned during the semester would be nearly impossible. Test are fair (arguably) but very challenging. Nice guy and good professor.","There are lots of stuff on tests that we had not learned at that moment but eventually did later in the course. Really helpful, but gives way too much work.","Professor will hold review sessions and he's very excited to teach but he isn't that good at lecturing, especially when explaining models. He'll hold the model in his hand and expect an auditorium to see it and understand the geometric concepts he's trying to explain. I learned almost all my O chem in 262 and would not recommend him honestly.","He seems like such a great professor in the beginning because he offers multiple review & help sessions every week. However, I realized how unreasonable the guy later in the semester. He basically expects you to live & breathe the material (from 3 textbooks-spent $300 for this class alone), and to a degree stronger than ANY other science class.","Although organic is reasonable with him, DO NOT take analytical chemistry with him. His tests are predictable, but the grading is INCREDIBLY unfair even if you know the material, specifically with acids/bases. It's great to be in classes with him, but he'll make you do a lot more reading and work than needed for analytical.","Professor Austell was very difficult and unreasonable. The pace of the class is too fast (had a lot of extra time after we had learned all the material). He's a nice enough guy and can be funny, but the stress his class causes you definitely isn't worth it. He gives no partial credit, and counts the entire answer wrong if sig figs are off.","I found Dr. Austell to be unreasonable and egocentric. I once argued with him about a vague homework question, and he turned nasty upon a disagreement. What I didn't like about his class was that it felt like he was very biased towards certain chemistry procedures that he had done, and it didn't feel like I was learning anything useful.","There is no partial credit on tests and sig figs matter but his tests are fair- almost no surprises.  Austell really cares if students learn the material and is extremely supportive both in regards to the class and your life in general.","Todd is a fantastic teacher and person. Genuinely cares about the success of his students and will do whatever he can to help you understand the material. Tests are challenging but if you keep up and use all the resources he makes available to you you can do well in the class.","Great professor. Wiling to meet with me outside of class, held great Q&A sessions beforeafter most classes. Tests were EXACTLY like the practice exams. Do those so many times you've memorized them and you'll do well in the class. No partial credit, but really fair grader. Funny and loves teaching.","Todd is a pretty good teacher, but also an egomaniac. If you play by his rules, you'll be fine. If you question him in his own classroom or accidentally deviate from his expectations, a different, more sinister personality emerges.  I more or less had to threaten Austell with reporting him to the dept chair to get a rational result."],"courses":["CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","21"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"CHEM","catalog_nbr":261,"section":1,"class_nbr":1661,"title":"INTRO ORG CHEM I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Genome Sciences BuiR loom","room":"TuTh","days":"08","time":null,"instructor":"CRIMMINS,MICHAEL T","load":"50","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":410,"enrl_tot":410,"wait_cap":26,"wait_tot":21,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=254294","fname":"Michael","lname":"Crimmins","quality":"4.2","easiness":"3.7","help":"3.7","clarity":"3.7","topTag":"Respected (11)","grade":"3.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["RESPECTED","SKIP CLASS?

Go to office hours, as he is extremely understanding and helpful.  Many of these professors push off extra teaching/help to TA's, but he cares about his students for review sessions. Rough class but no tests have curveballs, just need lots of time to study","I got an A in 261 with Crimmins and now an A in 262 with him again. By far the best organic chemistry professor at UNC. However, don't let you think that this is a walk in the park - you still have to do your part to get the grade you want. 262 in my opinion was harder than 262, and the average in the class was also lower than 261. Mike is awesome!","Dr. Crimmins is by far the best science professor I've had here because he is FAIR and doesn't try to trick you like so many others. At the same time though, fair definitely doesn't mean easy, but there's nothing easy about Organic chemistry anyways. Take him! You'll regret it if you don't because he's such an awesome guy.","Crimmins is one of the best professors I have had thus far. He genuinely wants all his students to do well and will do whatever he can to get you your best grade at the end of the semester. Go to his office hours; he dedicates so much of his time outside of class to helping students! He is the best organic professor.","One of the best professors I've ever had.  He teaches the material extremely well.  Just watch the videos, show up to class, and work the practice tests religiously and you will do well.","Best professor ever - I love Mike Crimmins. Tests are very straightforward and fair, but partial credit is minimal to non-existent so you need to know your stuff.","Dr. Crimmins is a phenomenal teacher. He is really engaging in class and gives students lots of outside resources like videos and practice problems. He gives his students all the things they need to be successful, but they have to study and work too. That's just the reality with Orgo. Definitely one of the best teachers I've had at UNC.","Has an online library of videos explaining the topics in his class. He or his class mentors are often available for help.","He is super easy to talk to and he respects his students. It is easy to get one on one help with either Crimmins or the TAs. He posts lots of helpful resources on the course site. Tests are hard, but they are fairly written. Best professor I've had at UNC hands down.","He's a really nice guy. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class. There's textbook readings and videos to watch. There's a clicker quiz every day, and you get to talk to your neighbors about questions, which is always nice. He gives practice tests, which are helpful. The content is pretty hard and requires good 3D-visualization skills.","If you have the opportunity to take organic chemistry (1, 2 ,or both) with Dr. Crimmins, do it. Definitely the best chemistry professor I have had at UNC. He is great at explaining concepts, knows how to write fair exams, and is truly a good guy.","Honestly the BEST professor I have ever had at UNC. His expectations for class are very clear and if you trust him and does what he says you WILL succeed. Tests are very fair and similar to practice exams. Offers plenty of extra help sessions. The workload is very reasonable for Orgo 1. To top it all off he is genuinely nice person who really cares","I'm not sure what changed between 2007 and when he came back to teaching in 2014, but I don't even recognize the person the other comments are describing. His lectures are very clear and concise. You can tell he puts a lot of time into organizing material into a way that will make the most sense. He has weekly Q&A sessions and last minute reviews.","Professor Crimmins was an extremely passionate teacher. He actually cares about students understanding chemistry, and it shows in how much effort he puts into making his lectures clear. His outlines are a little harder to follow but they really aren't necessary if you pay attention and read the book beforehand. Use the book! It helped a lot","He is very engaging and seems invested in students learning the material. The material by default is relatively difficult but his lectures are organized to teach you efficiently and he offers weekly review sessions. Tests can be hard, but its very similar to the problems in the text book. He's definitely the best chem professor I've had here.","He is friendly and his lectures are clear. His online videos are pretty helpful. He offers Q&A sessions every week.","Seriously, how does Prof. Crimmins have bad reviews?? He's an awesome lecturer, great at explaining the material, always willing to help during office hours, and he's funny. I guess I can see how others might find him condescending, but it's just because he wants you to do well. Take Crimmins. He rocks.","I agree-Crimmins is a condescending jerk-he doesn't seem to have much use for pre-med students or people who won't kiss his butt. He is definitely one of those professors who is more interested in his research than teaching. He doesn't make time to help those for whom orgo doesn't come naturally. Can't imagine being a grad student in that lab.","I found Crimmins to be engaging, but he was often condescending towards the class. He has very high expectations and knows his class is hard... probably prides himself on it. Good jokes, though. Not horrible, but not fantastic either.","Nice guy.  The lectures were excellent, he had the whole class laughing on multiple occasions.  Of course, it is OChem II, so it is quite difficult.  If you like multiple choice final exams, you might like this class."],"courses":["CHEM262","CHEM262","CHEM262","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM262","CHEN262","CHEM262","CHEM261","CHEM262","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM62","ORGI","CHEM62"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"CHEM","catalog_nbr":261,"section":2,"class_nbr":1662,"title":"INTRO ORG CHEM I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Genome Sciences BuiR loom","room":"MWF","days":"14","time":null,"instructor":"MOY,CHERYL LILLIAN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":200,"enrl_tot":183,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1984161","fname":"Cheryl","lname":"Moy","quality":"2.8","easiness":"3.9","help":"3.9","clarity":"3.9","topTag":"Tough Grader (15)","grade":"3.9","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GRADED BY FEW THINGS","GRADED BY FEW THINGS","TOUGH GRADER","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","GET READY TO READ","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","TOUGH GRADER","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","TOUGH GRADER","SKIP CLASS?

Her lectures can be rushed but just use the book as a reference and you'll be fine. She really cares about her students and I found her to be kind and helpful. The tests are straightforward if you know what you're doing.","She tries to be accessible but is very confusing in lecture. Oftentimes her solutions to example problems are incorrect and students have to correct her thinking behind a problem. Very test heavy and doesn't allow you to keep tests to study. She is condescending and gets very defensive when you question her methods, and her grading is unfair.","She tries hard, but she needs to reorganize.  She has occasional flashes of clarity, but more often than not her teaching is unclear to the point of absurdity.  You have to put a lot of effort just into deciphering her lectures to do well.  She can also be oversensitive to perceived criticism.  Still likely better than some other orgo professors.","Arguably the worst professor I have encountered in my life. I got an A- in the class but only because I taught the material to myself. Students would often have to correct her on practice problems and concepts because she was not able to properly explain it. Moy is condescending and incompetent.","I had orgo 1 with Crimmins and orgo 2 with Moy. She is not Michael Crimmins. She is still FANTASTIC, though. I came in to her class expecting a terrible professor from the reviews, but she was actually one of my favorites. She gives lots of resources for tests and genuinely cares about her students. I would take her again. I learned a great deal.","Probably one of the nicest chem professors around. Always willing to  help. The exams can be tricky, but if you go to to the optional recitations or office hours, you'll be fine.","She isn't bad at all. Well atleast not anymore. People have said she used to be really bad, but honestly she makes class very enjoyable now. Goto to class, goto recitation, use piazza, and ask her questions directly. Orgo is hard, but Dr. Moy makes it a lot more enjoyable!","Moy is honestly such a great person--she knows what she's doing but it's still a hard class. Not as bad of a teacher as everyone says she is. Was always able to get help and her test averages were generally pretty high . Obviously there's homework, but she gives lots of resources for practice.","The material is tough but she goes out of her way to make sure there is an abundance of resources available: studio worksheets, videos, active on piazza, she even held Q&A sessions immediately  after lecturing for two and a half hours. I, and the other people I know were successful in her class, took advantage of all of it. BEWARE OF HER FINAL.","Moy really isn't that bad other than that fact that she is a little condescending. She isn't the greatest teacher but you can do well if you're familiar with organic chemistry. I read the book before every lecture and did fine on her exams, which are surprisingly not that bad. The only thing that sucks is her final!","Her tests are probably easier than other orgo 2 professors here, but you will probably only do well if you teach yourself everything out of the book on your own. Terribly unclear in lecture, her sentence structure/diction is confusing. Sometimes she taught the straight wrong thing and wouldn't admit to it when people corrected her WITH THE BOOK","The bane of my existence. She is unclear during lecture and has some ridiculous expectations. We had to print and do guided reading questions and then upload them (about 30ish pages each exam). Her final was 44.5% of our grade - you could be fine before and still fail. She's friendly during office hours and exams are mostly fair. Mentors helped!!","Dr. Moy has the world's best intentions, but falls flat when it comes to clearly conveying concepts. She knows what she's talking about, and does say it, but almost nobody can follow what it means. I had to drop the class and hope to take it next semester with another professor, all the time and confusion just wasn't worth it.","I would avoid taking her.  She expects a lot of BS of what she doesn't teach and gives a ton of homework last minute.  Test are also quite hard and are graded unfairly.","I studied all the time and went to a lot of the help sessions. I thought I understood all the material until I took the exams. She was very unclear when teaching. I spent a ton of time on this class and should not have received the grade I did.","Moy improved soooo much as the semester went on. She's really concerned about everyone enjoying the class and learning. Initially, she'd have slides where she'd get ahead of the class, and she didn't have a feel for what exactly was tripping students up (had some trouble answering questions).  Now she's super understanding and great w interaction.","Dr. Moy got a lot better as the semester went on. After nearly 34 of the class failed the first test, she changed her teaching style and the class became better structured. Her tests were all very fair, though there is a lot of self-study involved. Unlike Orgo I, its mostly reactions so its double. After a few more semesters, she'll be great.","She was super sweet, and in a few years I think she will be a good professor. This year though, she was quite disorganized and somewhat unclear as to what she expected. Overall though her tests were very fair (except for a few questions here and there). She is definitely available for help and I strongly recommend going to the problem sessions!","Orgo is hard.  She was hard but pretty fair.  I got out with a C and hated the material, but at least she was enthusiastic.  Anyone who thinks she's the worst in the chemistry department needs to take a few more classes.  At least she smiles.","Moy is the most unclear professor I've had at UNC. She does not know how to handle questions and takes absolutely no blame when half of the class fails, going to great extents to keep the class completely uncurved. Her office \"half-hours\" are allegedly not for chemistry-related questions.
