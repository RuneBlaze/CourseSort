Paying attention and constantly reading and reviewing the lectures and powerpoints is crucial. But the lectures are entertaining, she's very funny, and you will really have to work for your grade","Dr. Cramer is an awesome person. She definitely loves what she teaches and it shows. However, She speaks super fast during lectures and at times, her power points are not very helpful. She does record her lectures, but they are not of the best quality. She is available to go over exams and help you with questions that you have. Be prepared to study","Dr. Cramer is funny and she talks super fast. She does record all her lectures, but the quality is not great. Don't get lazy in her class! You should review her material everyday no kidding. Her tests are extremely thorough you should study a week (or more) in advance. She curves the final. The final almost made me cry so STUDY I'M TELLING YOU","Dr. Cramer is very enthusiastic and talks really fast.  MCRO 251 is not an easy course, there is a significant amount of material, so very much self study was what helped me do well.  You can't study for a few hours the night before an exam and expect to do well.  Study diligently at least 5 days before the exams and you should do well.","Dr. Cramer is hilarious and makes the class super fun. She speaks very fast but records all her lectures. With that said, you should still go to class. Her tests are very thorough so you MUST study early Didnt know anything about micro and now I love it. She is really passionate and really knows her stuff. Definitely one of my favorite professors.","Dr. Cramer obviously really loves what she does and cares for her students. Her exams are tricky and frustrating, but the curve usually bails you out. The way she has structured the class allows you to fail one exam and not be completely screwed in the class. STUDY, STUDY, STUDY. Especially for the final exam. Seriously start studying ASAP.","Here's the deal: you have to work for this class. It covers a lot of material at a fast pace. If you're willing to study after each class and some on the weekends, you'll do absolutely fine. The lab is great! Best lab at UNC by far - fun, easy, and relevant. Cramer can be hard to reach if you need help - you have to schedule office hours in advance","Took this class post-bac while working and this class was not easy. Dr. Cramer's enthusiasm  and passion for the subject and her students made it a pleasant experience. She was always happy to talk with anyone if you made an appointment and give you advice on how to do better in her class.","Love love love Dr. Cramer! She truly enjoys the material and makes me want to come to class! That being said, she's not easy at all and she talks really fast. Overall, go to class, watch the animations, and go over her outlines and you'll do just fine! She's also really nice in office hours and really wants to help you do well.","Dr. Cramer is just amazing; she is undoubtedly the best professor I had at UNC. She is extremely passionate about what she teaches and very willing to help students out. She embodies what for me is the perfect Carolina professor, as she has a great passion for teaching and loves to reach students. Take her class, it will be worth your time.","Dr. Cramer is very passionate about microbiology. She is a very entertaining and engaging lecturer, and she very much wants her students to succeed. However, she speaks incredibly fast and does not do a great job explaining the subject matter. I really like her and the topic is very interesting, but she is not an effective instructor.","This class is awful. Homework takes hours upon hours and you still don't get a 100 and can't find answers. She talks so fast in class it's ridiculous. She makes it harder and more confusing than it needs to be. She will make you feel like you are stupid and doesn't care what you think. Hated Dr. Cramer although the subject material is interesting.","Just awful. More interested in making you think she's smart and you're stupid.Takes a subject that is difficult but understandable and makes it impossible.Encourages questions then insults you when you ask, especially if there's no one else around to hear it. Do yourself a favor and take this class with someone else so you actually learn something!","Dr. Cramer knows her stuff and is entertaining in lecture.  But the class is HARD and the tests are confusing (all multiple choice/matching).  Lab is easy.  Definitely requires a lot of studying for a good grade.  No paper.  Opportunity for extra credit.","Professor Cramer is clearly passionate about what she is teaching, but does a terrible job explaining what that is.  She gets excited and tongue-tied easily, making her lectures even harder to understand.  She jumps around on lecture notes and makes cryptic exams.  She encourages questions, and then makes students feel stupid for asking them.","Is obviously smart, but impossible to understand because she misspeaks in lecture all the time.  Her tests are equally unintelligible.  Also, you have to make an appointment to see her, even during office hours.  Not into teaching, just weeding people out.  Unfortunately you don't encourage people who would make great doctors and nurses that way.","Best teacher ever! The class is very fast paced and there is a lot of information but it is very interesting and she makes it easy to understand. She is very helpful and responsive to questions. I loved her class!","Class was extremely difficult..didn't like the multiple multiple questions..this class is definitely designed to weed people out.","She is an amazing professor.
