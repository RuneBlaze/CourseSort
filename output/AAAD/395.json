AAAD 89 was about Afrofuturism that semester. You have to read about 4 small books. If you show up, everything will be okay. Midterm was easy and there was no final, instead there was a final project. You got to choose what your project was and he just approved it.","Dr. Pier was pretty amazing. I took his AAAD 101 class for a gen-ed & it ended up being my favorite out of 5! I never skipped a single lecture for 2 reasons: quizzes & discussions, which were engaging. Lots of readings to do, but they were very interesting & informative. Thanks to him I'm considering another class in the department. Def. recommend.","I love Professor Pier! He's hilarious and inspirational. He runs his class like a seminar, allowing you to ask questions or add comments at any time during lecture. We read from novels, so no textbook. It's not difficult to keep up with the reading and it's VERY interesting. Tests are easy if you read and take notes."],"courses":["AAAD89","AAAD101","AAAD101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
