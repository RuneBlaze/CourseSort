He is very helpful in and outside of class and has great lectures! This was an 8 a.m. class, but he made coming to class worth it!","Great professor. Very helpful. He would bring snacks and class involvement was good because he kept it laid back. The course was supposed to be on Southeast Asia but was pretty much entirely about India. Still, being Indian he really knows the material and is passionate about it. He gives great study guides prior to exams as well. Highyl recommend."],"courses":["HIST292","ASIA136","HIST292"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
