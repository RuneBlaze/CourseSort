Every question on the test has an A, B, C, A B and C, A and B, and A and C option and it is almost impossible to determine which is the correct answer even if you know the material.  Discussion section is the only easy/very interesting part of the class and it is led by a TA and not Beck.","Lectures include her reading directly from a 60 slide powerpoint. Essentially, the class is an entire years worth of difficult biochemistry with no direction whatsoever from the professor. Exams are nearly impossible, as every answer choice includes 1) All of the above 2) None of the above 3) A, B, C etc. DO NOT TAKE."],"courses":["NUTR240","NUTR240"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR"]}}]
