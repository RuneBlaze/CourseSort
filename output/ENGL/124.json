You can only have 3 absences, but sometimes he'll replace classes with one-on-one meetings. For his comtemp lit class you do have to read a lot, but they're all good books and there isn't much work beyond that","Great professor. He's a relatively young guy (30s), so he relates to students pretty easily, & is also pretty funny. My favorite part about him is his clarity: almost every class he gives a concise summary of where we're going & what we need to do, & then always asks, \"any questions?\" He grades fairly, so it all depends on the quality you put in.","Love him to death","One of my favorite professors!  He has great assignments and is always very clear with his instructions"],"courses":["ENGL124","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":124,"section":1,"class_nbr":8939,"title":"CONTEMP LIT","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0301","days":"MWF","time":"12","instructor":"REINERT,THOMAS J","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":34,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":1,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=582539","fname":"Thomas","lname":"Reinert","quality":"4.6","easiness":"2.5","help":"2.5","clarity":"2.5","topTag":"Gives good feedback (3)","grade":"2.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["RESPECTED","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","HILARIOUS"],"comments":["Professor Reinert is an awesome human being and has this incredible self-deprecating humor that you wouldn't expect at first. Extremely knowledgeable in his field, has a passion for literature that I've never seen before. He's a tough grader on essays, but let's you rewrite them.  There are readings for every class, but they're typically short.","Professor Reinert is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. My class was on 18th-Century British Literature, which sounds boring, but he made it so engaging. He always cracked witty jokes and tried his best to engage students with the material. I worried about this class because I'm not a fan of reading or history, but I loved it. I recommend.","While I wouldn't describe his class as an Easy A, Thomas teaches one of the most interesting classes I've taken and holds awesome class discussions with minimal lecturing.  He also brings a lot of his own personality into the classroom, which really made it come alive.  As for grading, he lets you re-write all the papers as many times as you want.","Highly Recommend!!!","Great teacher. His assigned books are interesting, and class discussion is lively and engaging. A really cool guy who wants you to do well both in his class and in life. I'm not really an &quot;english person&quot; but I couldn't help myself from speaking up in his class because unlike other english courses his is not intimidating and/or dull.","Funniest professor I've had at UNC, an absolute delightful class to attend. Professor Reinert truly wants you to succeed, and makes final as easy as possible. Three papers are the course workload, the first two you're allowed to rewrite until satisfied with your grade. Absolutely recommend.","GREAT TEACHER.  So funny and lovable.  Really cares what his students have to say.  Never puts down any ideas or opinions.  Learned everyone's name in the class.  Chose mostly amazing books to read and discuss.  Never was really much into required reading, but I really enjoy this class because of him.","A really good professor. He chose interesting books to read and did a good job focusing on key themes and interesting passages. The papers were easy and you could rewrite them. He really likes hearing alternative interpretations from different people and doesn't shut people down just because he disagrees. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!","he's the best professor i've had at unc. i love coming to class everyday, and he makes the material so interesting and...moving.  I know that sounds corny, but it's true.  He's a genius, he's hilarious, and he really tries to get to know the students as people.  TAKE HIS CLASS, you won't regret it.","he's awesome, very eccentric, and he makes even the boring material interesting.","He is a great professor! He made the material so interesting and I really enjoyed coming to class! I highly recommend him.(Also- he lets students re-write papers!)","Great professor! I looked forward to coming to his class every day. . . he's very humorous and eager to teach if you are willing to learn.","Excellent teacher...extremely funny, made material very interesting. Made it a point to know everyone's name and treat everyone like an individual. Allows paper rewrites too-it's hard not to get an A in the class if you do the reading, put in the effort, and contribute in class. Easily one of the best profs I've had...","funny guy who makes class ok, though it's all about poetry. the only grades are 3 papers and final but you can boost your grade by talking in class. you can re-write your papers too.  &quot;i think snoop dogg is amazing.&quot;","great, self depracating sense of humor.  genuinely cares about students' understanding of the material.  allows resubmission of papers for additional points."],"courses":["ENGL121","ENGL331","ENGL121","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL436","ENGL121","ENGL068","ENGL121","ENGL068","ENGL21","ENGL21","ENG049C"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
