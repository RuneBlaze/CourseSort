This is basically a high school psychology class. I slept some lectures.   I didn't go sometimes.  I never read.  I made an A easily. He is a funny guy and is pretty cool.","Read the chapters in the textbook and you'll be fine.","Great Professor! Very clear in lectures and open to questions. Really good at explaining concepts and uses a lot of real world examples so the lecture doesn't get boring. I got a C+ on the first two exams, but I actually studied for the final and got a 93%. It is easy to get an A in the class if you read the text and study for the exams.","Professor Wiss is great! He often shows video clips or movies during lecture, and will sometimes assign a pop \"reaction paper.\" Attendance is important, as he occasionally gives pop-assignments and the exam material comes straight from his lectures. The textbook is helpful, but it mostly just supplements the lectures."],"courses":["PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
