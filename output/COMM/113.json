Dr. Watts cancelled class over 10 times, which is completely unacceptable. Lectures complicated and doesn't discuss many questions that you find in the tests.  If you're a COMM major, take it with someone else. Probably one of the worst I've had at UNC.","Dr. Watts is a very good professor if you're willing to participate in class. He cancels class at least once every two weeks. I didn't do readings AT ALL and I made a B+ on the first exam. He's very fun and one of my favorites by far.","THIS IS A HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! There are not enough characters unfortunately, but basically he doesn't show up to class, and when he does, he makes easy material convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. I am an Honors student and expected an easy A- had to drop the course bc our \"study guide\" for the one midterm was our readings syllabus. AVOID!!","Eric is very enthusiastic about teaching.
