I read the text and completed the homework and his class lectures still felt useless.  His tests are ridiculous (true/false, really&#63;), but the take-home portions were reasonable.  Overall, I think he does an awful job of relating the material.","Professor Ware lectures for self-aggrandizement purposes only.  he loves the sound of his own voice, avoids answering questions or gives mysterious, pompous answers intended to demonstrate his &quot;superior&quot; intellectual powers (e.g., &quot;from your question I infer you are a postmodernist&quot;), and holds his students in very thinnly veiled contempt.","Dr. Ware thinks he has explained something clearly because the students who have undergraduate degrees in statistics or math already understand it and answer his questions."],"courses":["EDU804","EDUC684","EDUCSTAT","EDUC684","EDUC684"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE"]}}]
