There was a required reading of at least one novel, usually more per class.  The readings were dense, the videos were boring, he was confusing, not to mention the 12 pg term paper. I would not recommend. He was also HATEFUL if you ever had to miss a class, even if you were sick.","Amazing!!","Very enthusiastic and knowledgeable.","Attendance is mandatory, but you really don't have to pay much attention as long as you look at the study guide before tests. Requires a lot of outside commitment - visiting synagogues and outside lectures. Ariel is funny and the TAs were helpful this semester.","Professor Ariel's class is a lot of work, but not overly hard. His lectures are somewhat unclear, but he tries. My issue is with the TAs. Don't expect to get anything graded back until a month after you submitted it. They are some of the laziest people on the planet.","Professor Ariel is very passionate about the subject. The workload isn't too bad. I learned a lot in RELI 72. If you are looking for an easy first-year seminar, do not take RELI 72. It's not that hard, but it is harder than most first-year seminars. I will say that Prof Ariel tends to interrupt people - even the guest lecturers. Don't take offense."],"courses":["RELI542","REL123","RELI123","RELI123","RELI123","RELI072"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
