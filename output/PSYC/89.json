The TAs are really tough graders (and the only ones who actually grade your material). Dr. Hopfinger goes way too fast during lecture, and for some people, it's very difficult to meet with a professor after class to look at certain slides.","Dr. Hopfinger is a good lecturer, though at times he goes too fast for those who take notes by hand. All his powerpoints are online and he makes an effort to engage his students. We had five 2-page papers that were hell; few people got full points on them. A few voicethreads and discussion days for participation. B's are very common, A's are rare.","Good lecturer. Definitely there to help you. Fairly easy class. Several 1 page research review papers. A presentation. A midterm and a non-cumulative final. He's somewhat boring but a very nice guy."],"courses":["PSYC230","PSYC230","PSYC230","PSYC230"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
