This is definitely a 200-level course, be prepared to put in the work.  Readings are usually interesting, some dull ones, but not often.  The CONCEPTS in the reading (which you go over in recitation) are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for exams and the research paper; do not skip them or lecture.  Great lectures.","Dr. Weiler is an awesome guy. He's knowledgeable and insightful, while welcoming student discussion and input. Also really approachable. Not incredibly difficult but don't expect an easy A.","An excellent course!  The material covered is very interesting.  Professor Weiler is very laid-back and approachable.  He tends to ramble and speaks very fast in lecture.  Taking notes and doing the vast amounts of reading assigned are critical to doing well in this class.  The course is very theoretical and requires you to connect broad concepts.","Very good prof and great class.  Lectures are interesting and cover most of the many, many readings over the semester, but keep up on your own and don't skip any.  He can be disorganized and repetitive so pay attention.","Incredibly well-read.  Leads highly interesting and discussion based classes.  Covers a wide range of important topics.  Great professor.","Fabulous professor.  Knows material cold, and does an excellent job of keeping subject interesting.  Any course he teaches is worthwhile."],"courses":["GLBL210","GLBL390","INTS210","INTS210","INTS210","RUES199"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
