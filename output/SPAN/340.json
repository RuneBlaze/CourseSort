His enthusiasm for the topic (Contemporary Spanish history) was very evident, and it was clear that he wanted us to learn. Participation is very important in his classes and is a significant portion of the grade. He is always willing to help and wants his students to try.","Great guy and great professor. You're going to have to put in a good amount of work, but you can get an A and he will help you get it. He wants to help whenever he can and is always making jokes. If you like Spanish and want to learn, take this class. If you don't like Spanish, don't take it.","Professor Monoz-Hermoso is definitely not the easiest professor I have had, but I learned so much in his class and could really feel my speaking-ability improving. He loves having discussions about issues of morality or historical events. Don't take this class if you don't like speaking in class because participation is everything.","I enjoyed nearly every aspect of this class, and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I mean, this professor is generally very understanding and wants to encourage students to do well. If you're lucky you'll get to experience the Spanish sense of humor and get to hear some cool music in class.","He has a thing about making sure it's \"los problemas\" and not \"las\", but he's great. He gives chances to make up for it when you forget to turn in homework (or just aren't there). But there is daily homework, and you never know what he'll take up.","My favorite professor at UNC. He can come across as intimidating, but if you take the time to go to his office and get to know him he is a GREAT guy. Participation is the key to your grade in this class. If you do the work this is definitely a class you can make an A in. But you have to take it seriously, he hates apathy.","I really liked him. He's a funny guy. His sense of humor is very dry though, and if you're really sensitive you might be offended. I felt like I had to teach myself some, but overall I thought he was a good professor. He kept class entertaining and interesting, and there's music every Friday!","He likes to make jokes in his class, so don't get offended if he teases you. I thought he was funny. The class went great until we had to learn something new. When he was teaching it to us, he got easily frustrated with our questions. The amount of homework was reasonable, I found the tests to be difficult, and participation is really important.","Really liked this professor...keeps class interesting and entertaining. You will learn a lot if you do the readings and pay attention. Exams are straight forward. Big on participation, be ready with questions and comments. Not too much homework, just a paper, readings, and occasional hw. Only setback was occasional lack of clarity w/ hw.Great class","So incredibly hard and very condescending.  Pretty sure he normalizes his grades, since I had an A going into the exam and a B- coming out (even though I know I didn't flunk the test).  Unless you suck up to him pretty hard, be prepared to find yourself on his 'apathy' list.","Funny man that is interested in the subject. A lot of reading, but a do-able class. Don't get overwhelmed right at the beginning!","There was a major problem with the calculation of my grade.  He was incredibly unresponsive when I went to him for assistance and I would up going over him to the head of the department.  He balked at her, but my grade was finally changed.","he's a funny guy and very interested in teaching this class.  I would recommend him to anyone.  Do the homework, participate and review grammar for the tests and your good","Great professor.  He is funny, engaging, and keeps the class interesting.  He is big on participation, so doing the homework is beneficial, even though it's not graded."],"courses":["SPAN340","SPAN204","SPAN255","SPAN340","SPAN255","SPAN340","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN340","SPAN260","SPAN260","SPAN03","SPAN4","SPAN4"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
