I had him for a FYS so my experience with him would probs be a little different. Easy class that was easy to do badly in because there were only 2 grades and they were moderately difficult papers.","He's not awful but he's not all that great either. The main problem is that the material can be very confusing and the TA's aren't too helpful and neither is the prof, partially that's just because the class is so big though.","He was a horrible explainer and the subject was complicated to begin with. When you asked him for help, he answered you with a question, which was not helpful. Definately not an easy topic and he makes it even harder to understand.","Being German, there are rare occasions where you have to ask him to explain himself, and it can also be difficult sometimes when he explains concepts. Nonetheless, he is a fun, young guy, perfect for teaching this sort of intro course."],"courses":["PHIL078","PHIL155","PHIL155","PHIL20H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
