She's an intelligent teacher that challenges you to learn and teach yourself through papers. The class is hard and there is a lot of reading, but if you care about the subject, you'll appreciate what you learn and you will learn a LOT.","Aloof, disorganized and very unclear with what she wants/expects of her class. There is a huge amount of reading; couple that with difficult exams, harshly graded assignments, dry powerpoints with little useful info, wandering lectures, etc etc... NOT a course I'd recommend."],"courses":["AFRI266","AFRI263"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
