He helped me look at life from a new perspective. He genuinely cares about his students and loves his job. If you want an A, he will work with you to get an A. I learned so much and it has been the best class I've taken at UNC so far. Highly recommend!","Has to be one of the best professors at UNC. There is no one more keen to help his students and every single class is basically just story time where he imparts valuable knowledge. It was by chance that I got him as a professor and I feel incredibly lucky that I did","Lots of group works over the semester (especially towards the end), so it depends on whom you work with. He wants you to learn in class, so makes you work, but is very fair and makes getting an A very approchable.","One of the strangest classes I've ever taken. Every lecture consisted of him going on for over an hour about something unrelated to the topic (his daughter's horse) and he always ran out of time. However, he really cares about his students and makes it very possible to get an A in the class. I would recommend, but expect extremely boring lectures.","Dr. Hammer is wonderful. He is the most engaging teacher I've ever had. Expect to work for your grade, but the extra effort is completely worth it. I would take this class again just for fun","Here you have my favorite professor at UNC. The class is well organized, engaging, and generally a lot of fun. Dr. Hammer is the figurehead of this course and will learn you a thing so interesting you may fall out of your chair. I got through the week looking forward to his course. YOU MUST ATTEND CLASS.","Dr. Hammer made my first semester at UNC so much better than I had expected. I wasn't very excited to be taking an English class, but he made it into my favorite class of the semester. His lectures are fun and interesting. We were always very engaged, and he loved good conversation. I would highly recommend any of his classes!","Dr. Hammer was one of the best teachers I've ever had. It was a lot of work, but totally worth it. I took the Health and Medicine class and it was a huge help with those unfamiliar genres. He is a great professor, very engaging and interesting to listen to. We did get off track a lot, however, and ended up rushing the last unit. Great Class","Dr. Hammer always kept the class engaged, and was fantastic in the small class setting. Knew the students on a more personal level, and was incredibly helpful and engaging with them all. Was a very fair grader, and gave excellent feedback."],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL143","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","143"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
