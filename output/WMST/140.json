Took her English 105 class T/Th and was never actually in class for longer than 30 minutes. She lets you go early every single day. Has way way less bs assignments compared to other English teachers. Wendy is the homie, take her","Dr. Weber's class was by far the easiest class I've taken at UNC. Minimal effort, no reading, no homework (she gives multiple class periods to work on assignments). She's not always clear with her expectations, but she is a super easy grader. She always lets class out 30 minutes early too.","So great. Very easy grader and very understanding if you cannot turn something in on time. Most of the class if working on your assignment and then getting to leave after 30 mins!!!","Weber is a nice and wonderful person. The workload isn't too rigorous. I highly recommend her!","Easiest class I've ever taken, including high school. Barely makes you stay more than 30 minutes and little work is required to get at least an A-","Wendy Weber is the bomb!  Very hard to get into one of her classes.  I was very lucky to experience her awesomeness!  The best/easiest english teacher","Easiest class I've ever taken in college and maybe high school. Don't need to buy any of the course material. She's really nice and lenient too, definitely try getting her!","She does not make you stay in class for more than about 20-25 min. I made an A- and did little to no work on the essays. Wendy is cool, just make sure you do the work. The book is not needed so don't bother wasting your money on it. Definitely take her class!!","Easy class and very helpful understanding teacher. There's a lot of reading but I did not read one book and made an A on the midterm. If you go to class, you'll do fine. 1 midterm, 1 paper, and final (all very easy and straight forward). Take this class if you want an easy A!","... if you go to class your fine, if you don't you need to read to make an A ... i didn't read any of the books and didn't go to class but still did pretty well with an A- ... not too bad at all","Really nice helpful & understanding.","Business Writing - SO EASY, so fun, really relaxed. Dr. Weber is great fun, easygoing and positive. She's also really funny and will tell you about her kids, and other tidbits from her life. I'd take her again in a heartbeat. One of the best I've had at UNC!","Class was really easy and fun.  She is really insightful too and open to input on class structure.  Only downside lots of reading.","Her class was easy and enjoyable, but there is a LOT of reading.","Good Professor-very helpful. Papers are easy-she is happy to help.","She is super easy. The class was never more than 20 minutes long. No one got below a B on any essay."],"courses":["ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL140","ENGL140","ENGL102","ENGL304","ENG22Q","ENGL22Q","ENGL11","ENG11"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
