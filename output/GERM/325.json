She is probably one of the smartest women I have ever met in my life. I would totally take any of her classes again. If you care about learning German as well as German CultureHistory, this is the professor you need to see.","avoid at all costs. this is the most insensitive professor i have ever had. I was .2 points away from getting an A and she denied me. Furthermore I am completely fluent in German, as I used to live there, thus I saw no reason why my oral exam grade was a -B. She didnt even care enough about the class to learn our names. RUN AWAY.","Don't be scared off by Dr. von Bernuth's seemingly intensive class at first. Yes, she speaks a lot of German and moves at a fairly fast pace however she is EXTREMELY  helpful, caring, and really wants her students to learn. She is one of the best professors I have had at UNC.  Make sure you visit her in her office hours!"],"courses":["GERM302","GERM320","GERM303"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
