Prof makes the material interesting. Attend class and pay a little bit of attention and you'll do fine. You work on a big group project all semester so make sure you get along with your group members! She lets you bring a page of notes to her test (easy!) Good class overall."],"courses":["COMP380"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
