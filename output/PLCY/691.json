Yes it is a lot of work, but global health policy is not easy in the classroom or beyond.","Prof. Meier has the unique ability to turn something typically dry (i.e. Ethics courses) into something not only interesting, but applicable outside UNC. His upbeat, bright personality makes coming to class a pleasure. Sure to keep you entertained & motivated (including  special office hours  \"Late Night With Meier.\")  Not bad on the eyes either...","Professor Meier is without a doubt not only one of the best professors at UNC, but all around one of the best individuals within Chapel Hill. His passion for health and human rights permeates into the brains of every student that has a pleasure to be in his class, whether you want it to or not. Get ready to be indoctrinated in the best way possible","By far one of the best classes &  professors at UNC. Prof. Meier's passion & dedication to human rights & all health issues is evident in his savvy lectures, publications, & detailed feedback. He challenges every student to think about human rights, the UN system, & its role in tackling global health issues from various perspectives. Great class!!!","If justice, musicals, dancing, and fabulous powerpoints are your fancy, then this is the class for you! The class is tough and expectations are high, but Meier is great and will provide MORE THAN ENOUGH opportunities to get help. You should attend all lectures and Meier keeps them interesting and engaging, so you won't get bored!","Professor Meier is the greatest professor I have had at UNC. He cares greatly about his students  and their success well beyond the classroom. He is passionate about teaching and global health policy, and it shows in the time and dedication that he puts into each and every lecture. He's truly someone that will inspire you to \"don't stop believin'\".","Not many opportunities to receive a grade so focus on the midterm, exam, and essay or  you can risk slipping. Professor Meier is incredibly compassionate, communicative, and witty. (And he knows it). He is wonderful and worth getting to know in office hours. Much singing, many photos, a good time had by all.","Best class I've taken at Carolina. Professor Meier makes you want to come to class and do well. He doesn't post lectures, and he takes an attendance grade, so going to class is important. Luckily, his lectures are a lot of fun. He is hands-down the most upbeat, fabulous, and caring professor I've had at Carolina.","Meier's class is not easy, but is incredible. The content is really eye-opening and he makes it so interesting to learn. This is the one class that I have always been excited to go to. I highly encourage everyone to take it.","Absolutely amazing. Puts so much effort into what could easily be a very dry course. Go to office hours if you have any questions, or if you don't- go anyway. Very inspiring and extremely helpful to students if you put in some effort to connect with the material.","Absolutely fedorable, I'm a huge admeierer.","Prof. Meier is AMAZING! He is absolutely HILARIOUS, incredibly smart, and cares about students! He makes himself extremely available and offers a lot of help with achieving your professional goals (preparing for interviews, contacts). His lectures are really interesting. He also bakes cookies and even made us an ice sculpture! Take this course!","Professor Meier cares deeply about his students. He is passionate about the subject matter and he injects so much enthusiasm into every lecture. Professor Meier is also always available to answer questions about material covered in class or to chat about the passions and career interests of his students.","The class was very interesting! Professor Meier did an amazing job at explaining human rights in a global health context! After taking this class you will find your passion in the global health field!!","Meier truly was excellent. The class wasn't easy by any means (and the material is a tad dry in and of itself), but the instructor truly made it worthwhile. Obsession with musicals was a bit confusing. One of the most caring professors I've had at UNC. Will challenge you, but will cheer you on. Seriously take a class with him - you won't regret it.","Great class! So much fun. Between the music and references, the topic and the stories, I'm not sure you can find a better class. Though at times the content wasn't my favorite, Meier always was, and it was a pleasure to come to class every day.","Absolutely one of my best Carolina experiences. It's such a treat to be taught by a professor that is truly passionate about the subject matter, and I feel lucky to have learned about such an important topic in this manner. I can't recommend this course highly enough--you will work hard, but it will be good for you (promise).","An excellent introduction to the international human rights framework and international law relating to health. Also fedoras, suits, and being fabulous. You'll learn a lot about all of those things too. Dr. Meier cares deeply about what he teaches, and you should absolutely take his class before you leave UNC.","Professor Meier gave me my first \"Carolina experience\" in the classroom.
