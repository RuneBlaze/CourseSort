I signed up for her class as an afterthought and became a Geography minor after one semester with her. I took another of her classes the next year because she was so great and I've never met a professor who cares more about what she does and about her students.","This class and Professor Olson are the reasons I decided to become a geography major. She is an excellent and thought-provoking lecturer. For a 100 level class this was more challenging than might be expected, but it was very worth it and the take away is incredible.","Professor Olson is one of the nicest, best, and most enthusiastic professors you will ever find. If you take an intro-level class with her (I had 125), be aware that it's just as difficult (if not more so) as her upper-level class. That being said I still did well in both classes, learned a TON, and absolutely loved every minute of class with her.","I was so excited to take this class, but Prof. Olson made the subject so much harder than what it could have been. Her tests were very hard and I never knew what exactly she was looking for. (Everything is written)","Way too difficult for an intro level class. I was a third year geography major when I took this class and I was well versed in the subject, but the tests even went over my head a couple times. Not an easy grader, slightly condescending, but you will likely learn a decent amount in this class if you really invest in it."],"courses":["GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG424","GEOG125","GEOG130"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
