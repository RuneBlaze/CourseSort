Math on  exams were problems never seen before or asked to solve. Homework/problem sets focus on computer science rather than math. I don't recommend this class although he is a nice guy and willing to help.","his problem sets are so long, lecture is pretty meaningless, and 60% of his exams are problems he purposefully chooses that no one has seen before. SAVE YOURSELF and take a professor that can teach!","Marc is clearly an intelligent man, but a terrible teacher.  Do not subject yourself to any of his courses.  His lectures are boring, rambling and disorganized.","Lecture could often be extremely boring, but he has a whimsical sense of humor and he is very passionate about the topic.  Take this class and you'll learn a lot, it will be so engrained into your brain however that you will not be able to forget it.","Do not take this class if you are not good at science even though it is supposed to be for non-science majors.  It is not an easy class at all.  He is very helpful during his office hours.   Lecture is pretty boring."],"courses":["ENEC222","ENEC222","ENST222","MASC051","MASC101"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
