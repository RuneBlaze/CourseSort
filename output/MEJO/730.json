I've never met someone who cares more about their students and wants them to succeed. Grading policies are strict, but you'll be a better writer because of it and will be thanking Lois when you're out in the real world. Super understanding & opportunities for extra credit.","She doesn't teach the class then expects you to know material from the lectures... there are only guest lectures","An awesome professor. Great personality. Highly recommend her courses.","Prof Boynton had a great personality, but she honestly doesn't teach much in her JOMC 101 class. The class really lacks any sort of cohesiveness, which I think made it more difficult for me. Definitely don't write this off as an easy A and fall behind. You really do have to attend the lectures, take notes, and do the reading to do well.","Dr. B seems like a great professor, but the problem with JOMC 101 is that she doesn't really teach it. There is a different guest lecturer every class, which helps explore multiple topics but makes for an awkward class. The tests can be a little tricky, especially the truefalse section. Overall the class was okay.","Baller.","Definitely tried to make the class interesting, but it was a bunch of guest lecturers that didn't really add up to a cohesive class. Homework and exams were very easy and straightforward. Pretty easy A class","Dr. B is great! Not only does she try to give us information we'll use in the real world, she's helpful and wants us to succeed.  I'd take another class with her in a heartbeat.","Dr. B is awesome. She makes class enjoyable by employing a variety of different professors from the J school. There's not a ridiculous amount of work, and the material, while subject, is not at all difficult. She's a very fun person and if you're at all interested in journalism, I recommend this class.","I loved Lois! For a 5:00 class, she made it more enjoyable than I could've have asked for! She's so nice and always willing to help, plus her emails are always encouraging unlike some daunting professors.  Some of the info is not crystal clear, but that's how must every subject is.  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class in a heartbeat!","Great, great professor. She's funny, discussions are interesting, and the readings are minimal (and interesting). I don't know why people say this class is so hard, it's really not as long as you put in the same amount of effort you would any other class. (It's easy not to because it seems like such easy material, but she's a tough grader).","By far the best professor in the J-School and probably the best professor I have had. She is very helpful and cares a lot for the students. She is really easy to talk to and always tries to make class fun. It's definitely not easy; she is a very tough grader but if you make an effort to go to class and work hard then an A is possible.","bottom line to taking intro to pr with lois, you're going to get a b, no matter how much work you put into the class.  if you're okay with that, she's not a bad prof to have.","Hey now! I thought she was funny. Really cares about the kids.","She tries to be funny. Sometimes she is, sometimes she isn't. Overall easy because most of it is your common sense, your opinion. She has power points and you have a midterm and 3 easy papers due during the course. I recomend it for an easy grade. Attendence counts!","Very nice and funny professor.  She makes the class interesting, and we have a lot of good discussions.  We also have guest speakers every couple of weeks.","Lois is nice but BORING.  Tries to be funny but is not.  Tough grader, too.","If only all professors were like this."],"courses":["JOMC232","JOMC101","JOMC","JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC232","JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC141","PRWRIT","INTROTOPR","PR","JOMC141","JOMC141","JOMC131","J141"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
