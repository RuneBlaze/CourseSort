He's a little hard to get a read on, one minute he'll be laughing and joking and the next he'll be summoning you to his office to tell you you don't talk enough in class.","Emilio is such a nice guy. He's very laid back, but he expects you to take the class seriously. He calls on people who don't raise their hands, so be sure to do the reading. He's really cool and has a great relationship with his students.","Great class, awesome professor, I would highly recommend.","My best suggestion is to simply agree with whatever he says and do not disagree with anything. Any original thought or opinion that is not in agreement with his will be overruled and be misconstrued as you not properly understanding the text. His grading and expectations are unclear and he is rarely prepared for class.","Laid-back, friendly dude who definitely keeps things interesting.  Not a class for people who want to just slide by, but great for anyone who wants a different perspective.  He's a lot of fun."],"courses":["SPAN373","SPAN373","SPANISH205","SPAN625","SPAN398"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":373,"section":2,"class_nbr":13221,"title":"STUDIES IN LATIN AMERICAN LIT Lecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0302","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"ESTRADA,OSWALDO","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":24,"enrl_tot":24,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":4,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1186021","fname":"Oswaldo","lname":"Estrada","quality":"4.6","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"Gives good feedback (2)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GET READY TO READ","PARTICIPATION MATTERS"],"comments":["Professor Estrada was an incredible teacher for this freshman seminar. He was so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and that motivated me to become more involved as well. He's hilarious and super helpful! I hope to take more classes with him because of how patient, encouraging and approachable he is. Definitely take him if you can!","One of my favorite coursesprofessors to date! So nice and relatable and just an all around nice guy ! Extremely helpful and easy to understand! I would recommend him to anyone!","I was worried about this class initially but he made it so much easier than what I had heard from other people with other professors. Strongly recommend!","He is the best professor I have EVER had. He is GREAT at keeping you interested in the material, always very helpful, extremely passionate, you will fall in love with him! :)","He is an amazing teacher!!! I am horrible at spanish and am doing really well in his class.. take during summer session and pay attention to all the details on the coutries. Fantastico!","No Comments","Very passionate professor, made me much more interested in the material. I felt that the class tries to cover too much, but that isn't entirely his fault. He is very helpful and explains things clearly, always open to help at office hours. Great guy!","His enthusiasm was contagious--a real passion for Latin American literature; however, I didn't take the class very seriously because it's so much easier than some of the other Spanish literature professors. If you're a Spanish major and take this class and don't make an &quot;A&quot; you need to find a new major."],"courses":["ROML58","SPAN344","SPAN203","SPAN378","SPAN204","SPAN456","SPAN373","SPAN373"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
