He doesn't believe in tests so the final only counted as 5% of our grade. There are two easy papers and the TA was amazing as well. They both really cared and wanted the best for you. The readings can be tough but Todd explains them all in lecture. Not what you expect but an awesome class nonetheless!","I wish I could take it again! it was definitely unexpected because it was more anthropology than religion, but I still loved his class. He always kept me interested. I took this class as a freshman and it definitely opened my mind. He clearly explained the readings better than any other prof I've had.  Grades depend on TAs though","reli 236 & 140: Todd is absolutely one of my favorite professors at UNC. He's a little out there, but he respects his students and makes difficult concepts more clear. He's very approachable.  If you aren't interested in philosophy/religion you probably won't like the class; but it's easy to succeed if you follow the readings & put in some effort.","He is very invested in the material, although he focuses far more on religious theory than religious practice.  I had him for religion in America.  Has midterm and final papers rather than exams, and uses attendance quizzes.  Doesn't make you get the textbook, loads readings onto Sakai.","Hated this class. Worst class at Carolina because of Todd.  Disliked his spin on INTRODUCTION TO RELIGION AND CULTURE due to his Anthropology background. Very Atheist and publicized his views. Confusing lecturer- not what I expected at all. Wish I would have read reviews first. Even our readings were titled Anth, not Reli. Not a fan. Very unhappy.","Liked the class but it was nothing like I expected. Viewed as more of an anthro category instead of religion and talks about lots of abstract things that you have to be open minded to listen to such as possession by gods or magic.","Really interesting class. This dude knows what he's talking about. Be warned - this class isn't about religious practice, as I expected, but about the thought process behind religion.","Lectures are interesting and Todd is obviously engaged, but he also talks in circles and the content is not AT ALL what anyone comes into the class expecting. Only take this class if you're interested in religion as an anthropological category and in abstract religious ideas"],"courses":["RELI121","RELI121","RELI236","RELI140","RELI121","RELI121","RELI121","RELI121"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","POOR","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
