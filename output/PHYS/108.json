Class is very boring and lecture material is completely irrelevant to assignments. He can be funny, but you are usually asleep for those parts.  No clue on how he calculates final grades.","This was a seminar class on Peak Oil. Cecil droned on and on about charts Al Gore style then gives out physics-based assignments (your only grades) with no relevance to lecture. Don't take.","Those who actually attended class usually fell asleep after 10 minutes.  The lectures are basically powerpoints and the poor guy seems depressed all the time.  Seems like he loathes teaching basic astronomy to apathetic freshmen.  Some classmates found it tough, so only take it if you're good at the sciences.","This was a first year seminar on energy, and it wasn't good.  I would not recommend taking the class.  Professor Cecil knows what he's talking about, but he wasn't good at getting us to know it.","really hard tests. he's a funny guy, but a really boring class. you don't have to go to class, but it might help, i didn't go b/c i couldn't stay awake.","There isn't much class work involved in this class. We sometimes had one assignment due per week. The tests seem impossible but there is a pretty generous curve. This class is interesting for the most part but I've fallen asleep multiple times in lecture.","No Comments","He's very scatter-brained and teaches in a very rushed manner. You never know what to expect from him - he forgot our only test and cancelled our semester project. Homework is generally easy except 1 impossible problem. The class is very generously graded. He leaves the country frequently but checks his email freuqently, fortunately."],"courses":["PHYS71","PHYS071","ASTR101","PHYS16","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR101","ASTR142"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
