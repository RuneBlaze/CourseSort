The textbooks aren't really necessary and they are really expensive I wouldn't recommend buying.","There is a ridiculous amount of reading for this class. Also, lectures are packed with a large amount of information that will not be on the tests. Note-taking here will give you a headache. Study hard if you still want to take this class, but for a 100-level course, I was struggling.","Cicek did not make lectures very engaging and interesting, so it was very hard to pay attention. Her power points were vague. My friends and I absolutely dreaded going to this class. The tests are very hard, she expects you to know all the drawn plans of each city. This course could have been better if taught by someone else.","Worst class I have taken at UNC by far. The lectures are long and boring, there is a ridiculous amount of material to cover for tests and exams, and there is a participation component in the class. Definitely find another class to get the WB credit.","This class wasn't too amazing, but it is a WB gen ed. It wasn't awful but the papers are tough and the tests are worse. Cicek was a pretty entertaining lecturer for the material but it wasn't enough, especially to keep my attention for an hour and a half. If you like ancient history, then go for it, otherwise you may want to look elsewhere.","She did not make the material clear at all especially the material for the midterm. She did not engage the class and her lectures were extremely boring.","I enjoyed listening to Cicek, however, Ancient Cities was hard to capture my attention at times. Her points however, are pretty clear and if you pay attention you should get out with at least a B.","Currently enrolled in the class, was told it was an easy way to fulfill a gen ed. Not true.  Class requires a lot of work, exams require so much preparation and it often isn't enough. The papers are graded with remorse for the ridiculous exams, but it still isn't enough to have a lift your grade.","I took this class having been told it was an easy A with a different teacher. This teacher in conjunction with Matt Schueller present long and extremely dense powerpoints on overwhelmingly mundane history. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Working hard for a B-/B. With that being said, Beeby is more interesting than the other lecturer and teaches better .","You can tell she knows exactly what she's talking about and she's very passionate about the material, but be ready for long lectures and the tests are almost impossible after *15 hours* of studying. Would NOT take again","Do NOT take this class. Material was extremely boring, and the midterm was full of ridiculously minute details that nobody could be expected to remember. She is a nice person but not a good teacher, gives unclear instruction regularly and is difficult to understand. I would recommend avoiding this class at all costs."],"courses":["CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120","CLAR120"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL"]}}]
