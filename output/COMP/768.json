Good but tough biweekly assignments and quizzes.  TA grading not consistent across.   Overall, I learned a lot.","Midterm average was 50 even though you get a cheat sheet. Weekly homework assignments and quizzes. You should read the textbook if you want to pass the class. She's passionate about the topic, but sometimes her explanations and answers aren't clear.","I took COMP 550 with Ming Lin, or rather, I sat in her class and watched her struggle to convey various concepts about algorithms for the semester. Bad lecturer and communicator. Gives unclear directions in assignments and tests and takes of points for things that were not specified. Take this class with anyone else if you want to learn algorithms.","Very fun class, easy A if you do the assignments"],"courses":["COMP550","COMP550","COMP550","COMP89"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
