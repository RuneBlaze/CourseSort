He assigned A LOT of problems from the book which weren't graded or anything but they helped tremendously with my understanding of concepts. He also cares a lot about your performance in the classroom -- make sure to take full advantage of his Q/A sessions!","Todd does care about studentS; however, he doesn't care about YOU- a student. He likes to be liked by all, but is short and narcissistic when it's one-on-one. He also expects WAY MORE than a student can do in a semester and still be successful in other classes, but he doesn't care. Many useless book problems. Final was my highest grade. LOW avgs.","Austell is a genuinely nice person that cares about his students. HOWEVER,  he excepts more out of students than is possible. His teaching style is also very odd, in that he briefly goes over concepts and a lot of what you learn is what you teach yourself.","Todd is a great teacher and a very nice guy. All the material he gives is overwhelming at times but if you put in the work you'll be fine. He doesn't give answers to any of his worksheets/review sheets, which is very annoying and my one dislike of the course. If you're willing to put in the work and take learning seriously then I highly recommend.","Really kind, amazing at lecturing, but I feel like he has an approach to learning that is more so focused on the process and less on the product, i.e., your GPA, which isn't necessarily effective. He doesn't post answers to the worksheets or practice tests, and relies on discussion on forums which isn't necessarily a way to gauge your understanding","Great lecturer who is excited about teaching the course, and students grasping the concepts. He produces a lot of additional material that can be overwhelming at times, but it's done with the best intentions of students learning organic chemistry. I highly recommend his course, but beware that lots of time is required to read and work problems.","Todd was probably the best professor I've had at UNC- he truly cares about his students and their success in life. He is constantly sending out reminders and encouraging people to keep up with the material each wee. That being said, the class is tough and he assigns a lot of work; be prepared to apply yourself and don't get behind on the readings.","Todd is the type that believes you don't have other work outside of his class. Of course you need to invest time into chem classes to do well (everyone knows that), but the time he expects you to put in isn't reasonable for anyone that is taking more than 12 hours. Love yourself and take someone else. P.s. he writes his own reviews, so watch out...","Excellent professor! Strongly recommend him.","Austell definitely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. His downside is the sheer volume of work he assigns, as well as the difficulty of his test. To do everything that was assigned during the semester would be nearly impossible. Test are fair (arguably) but very challenging. Nice guy and good professor.","There are lots of stuff on tests that we had not learned at that moment but eventually did later in the course. Really helpful, but gives way too much work.","Professor will hold review sessions and he's very excited to teach but he isn't that good at lecturing, especially when explaining models. He'll hold the model in his hand and expect an auditorium to see it and understand the geometric concepts he's trying to explain. I learned almost all my O chem in 262 and would not recommend him honestly.","He seems like such a great professor in the beginning because he offers multiple review & help sessions every week. However, I realized how unreasonable the guy later in the semester. He basically expects you to live & breathe the material (from 3 textbooks-spent $300 for this class alone), and to a degree stronger than ANY other science class.","Although organic is reasonable with him, DO NOT take analytical chemistry with him. His tests are predictable, but the grading is INCREDIBLY unfair even if you know the material, specifically with acids/bases. It's great to be in classes with him, but he'll make you do a lot more reading and work than needed for analytical.","Professor Austell was very difficult and unreasonable. The pace of the class is too fast (had a lot of extra time after we had learned all the material). He's a nice enough guy and can be funny, but the stress his class causes you definitely isn't worth it. He gives no partial credit, and counts the entire answer wrong if sig figs are off.","I found Dr. Austell to be unreasonable and egocentric. I once argued with him about a vague homework question, and he turned nasty upon a disagreement. What I didn't like about his class was that it felt like he was very biased towards certain chemistry procedures that he had done, and it didn't feel like I was learning anything useful.","There is no partial credit on tests and sig figs matter but his tests are fair- almost no surprises.  Austell really cares if students learn the material and is extremely supportive both in regards to the class and your life in general.","Todd is a fantastic teacher and person. Genuinely cares about the success of his students and will do whatever he can to help you understand the material. Tests are challenging but if you keep up and use all the resources he makes available to you you can do well in the class.","Great professor. Wiling to meet with me outside of class, held great Q&A sessions beforeafter most classes. Tests were EXACTLY like the practice exams. Do those so many times you've memorized them and you'll do well in the class. No partial credit, but really fair grader. Funny and loves teaching.","Todd is a pretty good teacher, but also an egomaniac. If you play by his rules, you'll be fine. If you question him in his own classroom or accidentally deviate from his expectations, a different, more sinister personality emerges.  I more or less had to threaten Austell with reporting him to the dept chair to get a rational result."],"courses":["CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","21"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
