I had to make myself come to class, and by the end of the semester I wasn't even coming to class except for once a week. Theres no need to go to class though, you can basically just teach yourself everything based on the powerpoint he posts. Wouldn't take a class with him again","Really cool guy and the class itself was interesting.  He tells lots of interesting stories about his personal stories and always tries to make you laugh and keep you engaged in a big lecture.  The only thing that was frustrating was how specific the tests were.  He gives study guides but they are way different from the tests.  random specifics","Really liked this class! Laid-back atmosphere and West tells great stories about his kids and the field work that he's done. The subject matter was interesting and not difficult. Would definitely take a class with him again!","Probably my favorite class b/c of West. He is very passionate about what he does and it's clearly evident. He's done a lot of field work, so class is interesting b/c he'll have \"West story time\" and never fails to make the class laugh. He assigns readings but I never read and have an A. Go to class and look over powerpoints (all the info is there)","Thor West loves his job and that definitely shows in the classroom. As long as you pay attention and go to class tests aren't that hard. He's so passionate about his work and tells so many little relevant stories that it keeps the lectures interesting.  He's such an interesting person and won't fail to make you laugh during class.","Coolest professor. He loves to tell (relevant) stories about his field work and his kids. He expects participation but it's very easy. Awesome class and he knows the topics and readings","West is great! decided to take ANTH 459 b/c I thought it sounded interesting, not thinking it was too high of a level for my year/major. However, it was my highest grade (A)! Not too much work, just a lot of reading. But he sympathizes when the reading is boring, so dont stress about tough ones. Helps a lot to be a naturally strong writer","West is really nice and enthusiastic about the subject matter. Warning: there is a lot of reading to do in the class, but he doesn't give quizzes. Available for help, only 2 papers and a small presentation and a bigger one. Great guy! I recommend him","Dr. West is a terrific professor. I knew nothing about Africa until I took his class. Now I know a lot and want to know more!"],"courses":["ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH238","ANTH459","ANTH459","ANTH238"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
