She demonstrates a deep knowledge and passion for the subject, but she also expects her students to advocate for their own education. If you need help, as she makes crystal clear, you need to ask her. If you do, she is more than happy to offer it. I highly recommend any class she's teaching.","This is the worst professor I have ever had.  She is needlessly difficult and vague.  The only existentialist thinker we discussed was Heidegger--not even Nietzsche or Camus.  She also didn't give enough notice for papers (one week notice or less), and even assigned a due date on a Friday at midnight."],"courses":["PHIL230","PHIL224"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
