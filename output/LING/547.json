His lectures are extremely boring and he patronizes people who ask questions in class. In fact, the lecturers themselves were useless as I learned all of the material during the weekly recitation.","Professor Terry is a nice guy, willing to help, and he wants you to participate in discussion during lecture.  He wants to make sure you're understanding the material and he cares.  He is passionate about what he is teaching, but the class can be a bit boring at times.  Tests are fair, he gives partial credit, and he is lenient.","He really does enjoy what he's teaching, and the class could be really interesting with that kind of passion, but he's incredibly unorganized.  I made an A because the topics came really easily to me, but if this isn't as easy for you, find a different prof who will make a little more sense.","The class was one that I took on recommendation of a friend and absolutely loved it!! Ive since officially changed to a Linguistics Major because of it. The teacher is pleasant, helpful, and enthusiastic about what he does. Take this class! :)"],"courses":["LING101","LING547","LING101","LING101"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
