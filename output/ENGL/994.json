There are readings for every class, but they're typically short.","Professor Reinert is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. My class was on 18th-Century British Literature, which sounds boring, but he made it so engaging. He always cracked witty jokes and tried his best to engage students with the material. I worried about this class because I'm not a fan of reading or history, but I loved it. I recommend.","While I wouldn't describe his class as an Easy A, Thomas teaches one of the most interesting classes I've taken and holds awesome class discussions with minimal lecturing.

She is one of the best professors I have had at UNC, and is both a true scholar and a dedicated, kind person who cares about students.  She's willing to meet & edit your papers all of the time, and has even told us that she grades all of the papers in her lectures. Very passionate about literature and helps you dive into it.","A fantastic professor that is an expert on her subject. She will keep you engaged and passionate about her class. I strongly recommend that you fight to get into a small, honors class with her, because she will edit all papers and meet anytime.  I would recommend her to anyone, and you should take multiple classes with her because she gives recs.","Dr. Wolfe is absolutely brilliant and one of my favorite professors at UNC. I knew very little about the topic of classical poetry before taking her class and now I have several new favorite authors and topics. She is sure to keep you engaged, expose new interests, and help you dive into the ancient texts. Have fun!","Absolutely brilliant professor. So knowledgeable and always gives very interesting lectures. Class had 3 essays and an essay-based final, so very writing intensive. She is very accessible and helpful with these papers. Overall, a must have professor at least once.","Professor Wolfe is such an interesting professor. She really knows her stuff and I learned a ton from her class.

During the last lecture, she said the material wouldn't appear on the final exam, and she joked, &quot;This is the part where half of the class is supposed to leave,&quot; but everyone stayed. The text was difficult to understand, but she clarifies the text in class. Beware: She does talk fast.","I really just can't say enough good things about Jessica Wolfe. She honestly opened my mind to an entire genre -- I used to find classic, epic literature dry and dull, and she revealed the complexity in each novel. What a great professor! So smart, approachable and cool. Can I be her when I grow up&#63;","Dr. Wolfe is by far one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is a brilliant lecturer and extremely helpful outside of class.

Totally worth it!","Floyd-Wilson leads interesting and usually engaging lectures about plays that can sometimes come off very dry. She lectures rather than leading a class discussion, which I enjoyed. She assigns two papers, and has a midterm and a final. The midterm & final are both passage id heavy, so paying attention to the themes and passages in class is crucial","Rewarding class, but can be tough.","Dr. Mary Floyd-Wilson was BY FAR one of the nicest, most approachable, and friendly of my professors. I took ENGL 225 as a freshman and, being in an upper-level English class made me nervous, but she certainly made the transition easy. She is very enthusiastic about her subject, and likes to see her students share that enthusiasm.","Very helpful.  Enjoyed class and it is evident that she cares about her students and is very willing to help.  Classes are never boring and she is very helpful in office hours.  Definitely recommend!","Professor Floyd-Wilson is EXCELLENT. She is incredibly knowledgeable. Her lectures are really interesting and if you attend and do the readings, you will do well. This is the second class I've taken with her and I'd take one again in a second! DON'T take Armitage over her as previously suggested-I've taken classes with both and she is FAR superior.","Easily one of the best teachers I have had.  I had trouble early in the class, but Dr. Floyd-Wilson helped me so much.  She has high standards, but she helps you meet them.  She's also pretty funny.  If you're going to take Shakespeare get in her clss!","She is very animated which makes boring texts seem a little bit more interesting.  She is also very willing to give extra credit if you need it.  If you come to class and take good notes, you will do very well on the tests.","She was terrific. The class was mostly discussion, and they were never boring. She read rough drafts and helped me a ton with my paper.  She also gave us the exam questions ahead of time. Highly recommended.","I was not in Dr. Floyd-Wilson's recitation section, but I really enjoyed her lectures.  She was funny and really smart.  The tests were tough, and to do well you had to do the reading and attend the lectures.  I really liked this class. :)","This was a big lecture class, 150 students.  Lectures were smart and funny, though they move fast!  TAs lead discussion sections.  Exams were tough but fair if you went to lecture.","Dr. Floyd-Wilson was BY FAR the worst prof I have EVER HAD in all my years at UNC. She reads prepared lectures, grades difficultly and inconsistently on exams, and is extremely unhelpful if not unfair. I NEVER complain about my profs- but Dr. Floyd-Wilson was definitely the worst. I heard Armitage teaches the best Shakes class. Do NOT TAKE this one","The prof. was a great lecturer. Her test were based on lectures. She expected that students had done the readings, and treated the students as competent adults. She is very clear and sometimes entertaining. I  would recommend this course to any student who is not trying to sleep through college.","She's got an unusual lecturing style; basically reads pre-prepared speeches.

An unreasonably tough grader for the low quality of the course.","The novels he picks are interesting, but his discussions aren't. It's nice that he truly wants feedback from students. Unfortunately, the class time felt like a caricature of an English class: a lot of his analysis didn't match the text. On top of that, he grades harshly.

Really willing to helptalk about assignments. He's a tough grader, I'm not going to lie, but you really grow as a writer and critical thinker. I've learned to look at literature in a totally new way thanks to him!","Good professor. Takes the material and papers very seriously. Easier to talk to 1 on 1 than you might imagine. He is kind and fair. Do the readings, though- he likes to give 'pop quizzes' on the material that make it really obvious if you haven't done the reading. Proofread your essays carefully!","He values students' feedback and is a very insightful prof. He's fun and engaging, but take the papers seriously, they're no joke! His Popular Genres class is especially great, we read detective novels, sci-fi, and Batman among other texts covered in this course.

Brit lit class hoping to better understanding some of the best literary works the English language has to offer. Dr. Langbauer's lectures are incredibly long and can be very confusing at times (she jumps around a lot). I think that she really tries, but the large lecture format of this class needs to be changed.","I've had three classes with Dr. Langbauer and loved every one of them. Her classes gave the freedom to engage in research and projects that I not only enjoyed, but yielded more than just an end of semester paper. She has taught me much and is the reason I was able to go on and publish one of my first essays.","So, I'm not done with the class yet and may end up getting a good grade, but wow. She's extremely knowledgeable and seems like a nice person--but that's not what makes a good teacher. Her midterms are preposterously hard. No matter how much you might study, it's all extremely specific, dumb things. I'm learning very little. Steer clear.","I adore this professor! Her lectures were entertaining and very informative. Her class was a very healthy balance of a straightforward, multiple choice midterm, a couple papers, and a short essay final. The only issue is that grading is up to the TAs, so your experience there could be good or bad.","Adorable, just adorable. She's a great professor - funny and engaging, she really makes an effort to entertain students while educating us. You *have* to do the reading to do well in the class, and the multiple choice midterms are tricky, but otherwise a great professor.","For Langbauer's class she leaves the grading to the TAs: not cool. Instead try to get into a class where the professor grades your work. It may be harder and your grade may not be as high, but you will gain more from the experience.","Dr. Langbauer is a mildly entertaining lecturer but she is prone moralizing and only presents her own reading of a work. She is very knowledgable but if you care about the subject this can get annoying. You MUST read all the books but they're some of the best books ever written. For an English class the writing is minimal and the grading is fair.","I hated this class -- Dr. Langbaur's multiple choice tests are demeaning and only care about straight facts. They are extremely poor indicators of whether or not you've actually learned. Her power point presentations over animated and all of her lectures are sporadic, incoherent, and feel like a waste of time. Not for the serious student.","Easy class if you're not a slacker student. Lectures are hard to follow sometimes but she makes really quirky powerpoints that provide entertainment. Def need to do all the reading to do well on her tests, which are all multiple choice and can be tricky sometimes. I've had her twice and have enjoyed both her classes.","Enthusiastic and happy teacher, with slightly tricky midterms but awesome reading material.  The powerpoints made me giggle.","No attendance policy.  I went to maybe two of the lectures and only to a few of the recitations the entire semester and somehow still managed to get a B in the class.

He explains dense and complicated topics with an unparalleled combination of specificity and accessibility. He's genuinely interested and committed to his students and their scholarship; office hours are frequently extended so that all seeking help get it. Brilliant prof!","Hands down, Shayne will be the best professor you've ever had. And the hardest. He is ALWAYS available to talk, really wants you to understand, and grades kindly if you show you care. Prepare to bust your ass doing tons of really dense readings and rewriting your papers at least 3 times, but it will be the most rewarding experience of your life!","This guy is probably the most intelligent professor I've encountered in 6 years at this school. For his age, he has such a vast knowledge of his field that it is almost hard to keep up with the discussions, but that's not his fault. Extremely helpful, the classes are NOT hard, make use of his office hours. An awesome prof.","","Awesome teacher!  My first class in which I can truly say that I had fun while learning.  He can be a bit tough but you will learn a great deal.

I only took this because it was open. not interested in Chaucer at all but became my favorite class! He is an amazing teacher and excellent at keeping you engaged! I would highly suggest taking a class from Prof O'Neill! Also he is CRAZY nice and in my top 3 professors at UNC, and don't get the book the translations are online for free..","He's an awesome teacher! He is really funny and makes a really boring subject interesting. He's a tough grader on papers but he's always willing to help.","Loved Prof. O'Neill! Made British Literature (which I think is a pretty dry subject) extremely interesting. He's great and makes it clear from the start what his expectations are. He's a tough grader, but he's more than willing to help with papers/presentations. Take him!","Great professor, really made Chaucer interesting.  Daily quizzes but just know your minor characters.  exams were tedious but no suprises, he gives you everything in his lectures.  Would take another class if he had one.  Very well recommended","Very good teacher, organized and interesting.  His tests are not cakewalks but you can make good grades with very modest amounts of studying.  The Chaucer book is not really needed, you are better off using online or paperback versions with line by line translation.","Great teacher.  Will learn a lot and have fun while doing it.","Funny guy, but grades pretty harshly. Must remember lots of dates and facts--not as much into interpretation--at least in the survey class I took with him. Makes class interesting, though, with his sense of humor!","he was good","excellent teacher, wants you to learn but also to enjoy learning","Had him for a summer course in Adult Ed.  A fab teacher and a good program organizer.  Great with the 20th cent. Irish poets.","One of my favorite English professors and one of the few I remember from my time in Chapel Hill. I definitely recommend him.","He's great - very helpful, smart, witty, and makes the whole class interesting and fun.  Take a class from him!","O'Neill rocks.  Very funny and a great teacher.
