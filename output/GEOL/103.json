He listened carefully to feedback after each exam, incorporating the feedback into how he ran the class (almost personalizing it). His lectures are long and not very interesting, but you don't necessarily have to go to class to pass. Overall great guy.","Karl is very competent. He is extremely clear, creates all the notes you will need in powerpoints, and gives you study guides. I found this class *very* easy. That being said, averages on the tests were around a 2.5-2.6 gpa (?), even after he bumps them up by 6-10%. If you're competent, you should do really well. It is an interesting course.","The best professor I have had. I took his Marine Science class first semester of my freshmen year and he made the class so amazing I declared a minor and hope to take all classes with him! He is the most caring and understanding professor there is. He always makes sure you are on the right track and tries to get to know you. Awesome professor","MASC101 and GEOL103 are the same course - Karl is not just an awesome professor, he's an awesome person. exams are easy if you follow the notes. he gives a comprehensive study guide before each exam. really understanding and willing to help anyone!","Great Professor.  Very Enthusiastic!!!","Great Professor.  Very Enthusiastic.","He is from Belize and is difficult to understand. He also didn't wear a mic in a large lecture hall, very hard to hear! When going through power points he doesn't give you time to write down all the notes!"],"courses":["MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","GEOL103","MSC01","GEOL103"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}},{"subject":"GEOL","catalog_nbr":103,"section":2,"class_nbr":6310,"title":"MARINE ENVIRONMENT","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Wilson","room":"0107","days":"MWF","time":"14","instructor":"WHITE,BRIAN L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CTOPS"],"enrl_cap":55,"enrl_tot":39,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1269411","fname":"Brian","lname":"White","quality":"2.0","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"Inspirational (1)","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["INSPIRATIONAL"],"comments":["At the beginning of the semester I was going to minor in Marine Science, but this class made me hate the subject. He's pretty disorganized, the final was today and we didn't get the study guide until yesterday. The tests aren't always on what's on the study guide. His voice is pretty boring and he is very awkward to be around. I don't recommend it.","I am a biology major but have gone back to take this 100 level course and have really enjoyed Professor White. His voice IS a little monotone, but as a science major I am used to that and the subject matter makes ALL the difference. The subject is fascinating. Most of all, I enjoy his lectures. He has great diagrams!!!","Not very enthusiastic. He seems to know a lot about the subject, but he just comes of as boring.","Terrrrrible. Waste of time. This guy is smart but he is BORING. Nervous, awkward, not engaging. Try something else.","BORING. Didnt go to class. Just look over the study guides and you'll know everything for the exams. Final is copied and pasted from midterms.","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Very boring instructor with a horrible use of powerpoint presentations.  His voice is annoying, he is jittery, and he does not engage students at all! The textbook is a waste of $$$ too.","VERY BORING! He has an annoying voice, jumbled powerpoints that repeat one another, and is not entertaining or interesting at all. The book is useless too.
