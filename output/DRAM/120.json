His discussions are interesting and sometimes he even sings. He is very understanding and accommodating of students. However, there is a lot of reading and he can be a pretty tough grader on play review papers (I always get A's on writing assignments, but I can't get higher than a B+ with him).","Adam Versenyi is very good at illuminating the meanings of the most obscure dramatic texts, however, he can be a bit boring at times. I have also never gotten bellow or above an A- on anything yet (this is my second course with him). He is very nice, and quite helpful.

(This course is the first in the major, I just took it for VP credit). Coming from a math major, sometimes the lectures felt long, but he was really cool and fun to listen to. The homework was very manageable, especially if you have read the plays already.","I had Mark for both 120 and 231 (Playwriting). Easily one of my favorite professors at UNC. Intro classes can easily feel dry with some profs, but put in the effort, and he will teach you a lot. Great guy to know outside of class as well as a theatre practitioner and collaborator.","Mark is not very clear on his expectations for assignments or what he wants for you to be able to receive a good grade. Attendance is mandatory, but the classes do not relate to the work you do out of class. There are only 2 tests, but there is a ton of homework. You do have a week or two to complete all of the assignments, but it is a lot.","Mark is a super cool professor. If your not interested in drama the class can be boring but its worth it because it is so easy. There is a decent amount of work but you have plenty of time to do it. Read the plays and do your play profiles well and an A is completely attainable.","Mark is a great guy and awesome teacher, but he can get off topic easily and often couldn't cover the material in time for exams.","Mark is an awesome guy. Take this class from him and you wont regret it!","Though I wasn't interested in the class prior to taking it, he made it enjoyable. He's very enjoyable and a good teacher.","Perry was a great teacher! I was not looking forward to taking play analysis but he actually made it fairly enjoyable and interesting. There is a lot of homework but it's all due at only three points in the semester so you have a lot of flexibility there. It's a fairly simple class if you go and read the plays.","Perry is a good professor, however, he assigned a ton of &quot;busy&quot; work.  He also makes you read Hamlet in one weekend.  His class is run like a high school course.","I don't know him as a person, I'm sure he's nice, but he's probably one of the dullest professors I've had at UNC. Lectures are excruciatingly boring to sit through and I feel like he's overly dramatic when talking about everything.  Class could be half as long if he just said what he needed to in a timely fashion.","Great professor! I just took this class for the visual arts requirement but he makes it totally interesting and fun. Grading was a little harder than I expected, though.","Mark is a great professor. He actually connects with students and cares about them. His class is engaging, and the material challenges you to think critically, so be ready to work and participate. I highly recommend his class.","Mark rocks! He makes class fun and interesting. You're totally free to speak your mind. The Play Analysis class does have some busy work but it's not hard and is spread out pretty evenly over the semester. Aside from the project, you really only have one or two small things to do per class period. I would recommend Mark for any Drama class!","Mark's a really awesome guy! Take his class if you can. I really liked him :-)","Nicest guy ever, very interesting, very friendly. Got a lot of out his class","No Comments"],"courses":["DRAM120","DRAM120231","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAMA115","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120","DRAM120"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"DRAM","catalog_nbr":120,"section":4,"class_nbr":1280,"title":"PLAY ANALYSIS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Center for DramaticRoom","room":"TuTh","days":"09","time":null,"instructor":"KABLE,GREGORY A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["VP"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":35,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=38308","fname":"Gregory","lname":"Kable","quality":"3.7","easiness":"2.2","help":"2.2","clarity":"2.2","topTag":"Hilarious (4)","grade":"2.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SO MANY PAPERS","GET READY TO READ","TOUGH GRADER","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","HILARIOUS","GROUP PROJECTS","AMAZING LECTURES","HILARIOUS"],"comments":["Kable's lectures are fantastic! I never thought I would enjoy a drama class but we read so many different plays I had never heard of that I thoroughly loved. He's funny and tries really hard to make everything relatable. I really like his interpretation and analysis of each and every play and how he connects it to contemporary culture. Take him!","Kable is quite a character (in a good way)! Never thought I would enjoy a drama class, but the plays we read actually aren't bad at all. If you go to lecture and actually jot down what he's saying (and do other crap the entire time) you'll ace the tests. It's all pretty straightforward and Kable is a fun guy.","Okay so Drama 115 should be an easy A right? Not with this professor. I made a B- with a lot of effort as compared to friends with no work and A's with another professor. The tests are half true and false, which are extremely easy to confuse so don't think of true and false as something easy. He talks the entire hour with slides with literally pics","Loved Greg! He's hilarious in an eccentric way. The assignment descriptions are not entirely clear, but as long as you put in a visible amount of work, he'll appreciate your effort. Definitely recommend for anyone, not just people interested in drama!","very eccentric, love him to death. took DRAM81H, was super fun and an easy A! highly recommend","Prof. Kable makes his lectures fun.  I had him for DRAM 292: The American Musical.  His lectures are full of comedy and videos that explain exactly what he is talking about.  While his grading rubrics are always the clearest, if you need help, it's definitely there.  Attendance policy is very strict.  GO TO CLASS!!!","Professor Kable clearly loves Drama, and this drama class is really fun and gets rid of a lot of GENEDS.  Its not too hard at all, and his grading criteria for essays is always very specific so you know what to do to get a good grade.  Definitely recommend this seminar.","My 2nd class with Kable. I love him- favorite professor here. Makes my day bright with clips from Lady Gaga concert footage, Mean Girls, Glee, and Pitch Perfect.","This class is completely doable.  Kable makes the subject interesting and when I took this class last spring it was easy to do well if you did the assigned readings and came to class.  The paper is daunting at first, but it really isn't that bad once you get started.  Would definitely recommend!","Take this class with this professor! He is absolutely great! Makes a dull non-major subject very interesting. I was dreading this course when I enrolled but it is definitely one of my favorite classes that I have taken. Kable is the man!","His personality will strike you, he's funny and witty although he won't look like it at first glance. Very passionate about theatre and is enthused with class participation. Test we multiple choice and true/false so they could be tricky, but they were generally easy if you pay attention to lecture","Great professor! No homework outside of a few papers/group project. Not a lot of work and an easy grader. Class is mandatory (with the exception of a few absences he'll excuse) but reading is not mandatory. As long as you read up on sparknotes before class you can generally be fine in the class discussions which are voluntary to speak in.","Funny and clever but lectures are often monotonous, tests are confusing.","A really fascinating lecturer but his tests are confusing and difficult.","He was one of my favorite teachers. such a great class to go to.","This class was pretty easy. Kable's lectures aren't that boring, considering that it's drama. If you take good notes and are good at memorization, you'll be fine.","Prof. Kable is great! He's a really nice guy, and is very passionate about theatre.  He relates all of the plays to today by comparing them with movies and TV shows today.  There are four essays a semester, including the final exam.  There is almost never any homework besides reading plays.","Professor Kable is passionate about what he teaches and makes classes interesting. Makes drama enjoyable even to those who are not interested in the arts","I love Greg. He's interesting and knowledgeable and it's obvious that he cares about teaching. Make sure you know the information on the study sheets and you'll be golden on tests. Attendance isn't mandatory, but class is always interesting; he shows film clips every day and often gives extra credit.","The A was much harder to get than it should've been with my prior knowledge because TAs arbitrarily grade papers (mine had only a 3 word comment) and test questions can be ambiguous even with studying. Still, it's a fun class with an entertaining professor. Start the paper early and come every day in case he gives EC (esp days right after tests)."],"courses":["DRAM285H","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM81H","DRAM81H","DRAM292","DRAM81H","282","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM120","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAMA115","DRAM81","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
