I just wish he would bring more of his (Tier 1) research to the classroom.  I suspect he was unimpressed with the quality of our class...

Never prepared for lectures, which are a waste of time as he bumbles through material with his back to the class.  Takes 2 weeks to return exams and hw.

His class is very straightforward and it is very easy to do well. Take notes, read the textbook, do Aplia assignments, and complete practice tests. He is a cool guy and he's always willing to explain difficult concepts.","Attend lectures, do aplia, but most importantly study practice tests. Lectures can be boring but somewhat entertaining at times. Aplia is annoying","Conway was awesome. You need to do well of the midterms and final to get an A in the class. There is a lot of busy work involved, but if you take the time to read the text book while completing the online homework assignments, you'll learn about econ.","Professor Conway is a pretty cool guy. He keeps the rather boring material interesting with heavy use of Poll Everywhere. Never left class without a laugh. Keeps students engaged and makes sure we know what we need to know. His tests can be tricky. I studied for hours, and made B's. Otherwise, he's great. If you have to take Econ, take Conway!","Conway is a great professor. He is funny and engaging. He uses examples that are relative to college students, which makes it easier to focus. Aplia assignments due every Tuesday and Thursday, but they help for practice. Tests are somewhat hard.","I loved Professor Conway! He is so sweet and really cares about his students. As long as you put in the work, you'll be able to make the grade. Best option for Econ 101 at UNC.","Professor Conway is very friendly and approachable. His lectures are long and can be boring but it is absolutely imperative that you pay attention during lecture in order to do well. It is not necessary to read the text book (I would't even waste money on it) though it can be used for clarity. Make sure that you understand the practice exams.","When it comes to exam scores, the difference between an A+ and a B could be 3 questions about music. The group project was also a mess.","Straightforward, knows what he is doing. Lectures can be lengthy at times. Completing the Aplia assignments, going to class , and taking notes will earn you a good grade. Tests can be tricky and wordy at times.","If you're taking ECON, TAKE IT WITH CONWAY. By far the fairest grader out of all the professors. His tests are extremely straight forward. Heavy amount of homework but it helps.","Conway is definitely one of the easier econ professors, so if you can take it with him then you should! however his lectures can be boring, i often found myself dozing off in his class. also the online homework (aplia) assignments are very long and boring. Always do the practice exams, they are literally the same questions as the actual exams.","Conway is super nice and has a very soothing voice. Some times I will be focusing on what he is saying and then five minutes later, find myself deep in some other thoughts. (moral of the story, it's kind of easy to tune him out, so you have to try really to focus on his voice.","Conway is an amazing professor and he knows what he is doing. His lectures are long, but he goes at a nice pace and explains everything in depth. If you go to class, take notes, and do the Aplia assignments, you will do well. He does take attendance through PollEverywhere, and you loose fractions of a percent in the class for missing. Take him.","Easiest Econ teacher at UNC. Lectures can be boring at times but Aplia assignments help. He goes over everything pretty thoroughly and will stop and take time to answer questions.","I really enjoyed this class. You have online homework due each class which was relatively easy. The midterms are almost identical to the practice midterm he gives you so that helps a lot. Going to class didn't help at all and lectures felt long, but if you read the book then you'll be fine.","Conway if the best econ professor at UNC! He takes his time going through the material and is really nice. If you read the book you don't even need to go to class.","Extremely boring lecturer. Class felt like an eternity. Relatively easier compared to the other econ 101 professors. There's a lot of online homework assignments.","He is the best Econ professor at UNC. Grades fairly, and is generally a nice guy. Would take another class with him","He isn't the most interesting guy during the lectures, and a lot of the info is irrelevant. However, if you read and do the Aplia (which is super helpful) you will understand most stuff. He gives practice tests, which are just the exams from the year prior, and he takes a lot of questions right from there along with changing the numbers on others","The most boring professor I've ever had!
