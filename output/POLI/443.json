YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["Awful","This was not an easy or simple class, but most of it was fairly interesting if you're Poli Sci. The grades were 35% from your term paper, 25% from final, and the rest is a mix of participation online reading quizzes.","Demanding but you learn a lot. Don't expect to be able to skate by but if you want a serious class that goes into detail and rewards hard work take it with him.","He is one of the BEST Professors at UNC! He is extremely resourceful and helpful with the course material. If you are a student that wants to gain a great intellectual experience at UNC, then take his course. He definitely is engaging and helpful!","Don't take the class if you're not willing to work hard. There's a ton of reading and a huge research project. But I found the class very interesting. McKeown is not the most personable professor, but his lectures are effective and he was really helpful with my paper. Best class I've taken at Chapel Hill.","I regret taking this class every time I step in the room. He's probably the most patronizing professor I've ever had and he'll make you feel like a moron for no reason. He's smart and he wants you to know it. It's close to impossible to understand what he's talking about half the time. Stay away at all costs.","While he may know what he is talking about, he does not relate very clearly at all.  Even worse than that, he is extremely condescending, and does not seem to care about his students.  I thought a smaller class atmosphere would be interesting, but not so.  I pulled off a C, but having to deal with him every week was practically unbearable.","McKeown may be smart, but he isn't a very understanding or kind person at all. He's really vague and not helpful at all when it comes to clarifying comments or the readings. He assigns a lot of reading and hard quizzes that have very little basis in the readings for the week.","He is extremely strict, but extremely intelligent.  Not the best lecturer, but if you are a studious student who isn't afraid of doing a lot of reading, take his class.  He will teach you a lot.","He is absolutely the meanest professor I've ever had.  Not only is he condescending, but he is also not very helpful or understanding of students' situations. I thought at first that he was just &quot;clever&quot; but now I feel as if he intentionally degrades students for his own satisfaction.","Not a nice person at all.","Every time I read news about foreign policy, I realize how much I learned in this challenging class. Yeah, he's tough. Readings are heavy. But here's what's cool: this class is totally geared to good students. If UR1, you'll do fine. The hungover dudes drop like flies.","This guy is a jerk. Avoid him like the plague. He's not helpful, he assigns too much material (100 pages/night), and he is downright mean. He asks for comments in class and then cuts you down."],"courses":["POLI254","POLI443","POLI443","POLI254","POLI443","POLI252","POLI060","POLI060","POLI86","POLI443","POLI144","POLI144","POLI144"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
