She is very helpful and concise in her office hours.  Be prepared to work hard and visit her office hours.","She is a really bad teacher. Not only is she unclear in her expectations, but also in her class assignments and &quot;feedback.&quot;  Too many group projects that were irrelevant. Not approachable or friendly. The class description and activity were totally unrelated. Unnecessarily harsh grader and no fun.","she's really full of herself and a boring lecturer.  I don't recommend taking a class  with her at all. She gives you absolutely no indication of how you're doing in the class, focuses on group projects that don't really pertain to the material you're learning, and then hits you with a killer final. Impossible."],"courses":["PLAN246","PLAN246","PLAN246"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
