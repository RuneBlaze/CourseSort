I had her for both Secured Transactions and Banking Law.  She is knowledgeable, straightforward, and practical, which is appreciated when the subject we are discussing is difficult to understand.  She is also very accessible (great open door policy).","Thought she was great while at UNC, but being in the field (in a round-about way) 5 years after graduation makes me appreciate the class much more.  Also is a great representative of the UNC SoL's prominence in the field.","Broome is a good teacher. She covers every important bit of her book in lecture. However, there is a lot of material, and a ton of it is either (1) not current law or (2) not law at all (the business aspect of banking)."],"courses":["LAW275","LAW101","LAW237"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
