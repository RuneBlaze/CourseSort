You won't find any surprise on his tests as long as you go to class.","He gives awesome lectures and very easy tests. The workload is average. It's helpful to review MATH383 before you take this class.","By far the best math teacher I've ever had. As long as you go to lectures and pay attention, his tests are easy to study for and to pass","Taylor is an awesome professor!  He is approachable and very easy to talk to. The tests are very easy as long as you do the homework.","I really enjoyed this class. 521 is a very hard course in general but his teaching makes it much easier. His exams are very fair. If you review the homework before the exam you should be fine. Dr. Taylor is also very helpful and really approachable to ask questions. Strongly recommend!"],"courses":["MATH521","MATH524","MATH521","MATH521","MATH521"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
