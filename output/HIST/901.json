YOU WON'T PASS.","RESPECTED"],"comments":["You have two options for this class: go to the lecture, or read the \"textbook\" (his own novel.) The grading is very specific -- do exactly what you think he wants, and do it to a t. You need to hit key points to make it in this class, and that means no rhetorical flourishes. Just tell him what he told you. The TAs did basically everything.","Chasteen is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject. However, his lectures are very disorganized and he tends to ramble a lot. If you stop paying attention for 5 min, you are lost. Attendance in lecture is not required but it is for recitation. 1 midterm. 3 papers based on books. 1 final. Exams are ID style. TAs made the class v difficult","I'm a History major, but this class wasn't great. Chasteen's a nice man and I ended up with an A overall. However, the lectures have no structure whatsoever. He tends to ramble so often that his lectures are more tangential than actual substance. Still, though, it was a relatively easy course, if frustrating due to the lack of organization/clarity.","Professor Chasteen is a wonderful professor! One of the very best I've ever had at Carolina. He really knows his stuff, he's a great lecturer, you come out knowing the material backwards and forwards. I would recommend him to anyone.","Chasteen's lectures are boring and useless.  He rambles about something, and you learn the actual material from your recitation.  Taking notes in this class is pointless since the material is so easy.  I sat there most of the time asking myself why am i in this class.  But the worst part is that he takes attendance.","Weekly reads and responses, three papers that aren't bad - all graded by TA. IDK what the person below is on, but the lectures are important. He clearly lays out the themes of the course and connects ideas. Doesn't focus on the details.","I was very interested in the course material, but Chasteen's lectures are useless. If you do the reading, don't bother going. He just rambles about vague concepts. He says exams will not require specific knowledge of buzz words, dates, etc...but they are ID format. Beware. Not what I expected.","I cannot say enough wonderful things about Chasteen! His classes are always interesting and entertaining- I learned a ton. Take good notes and do the readings, and you'll do fine. One of the rare professors who knows how to keep you learning and interested without assigning ridiculous amounts of work! Take his class!!","Has students buy his books, including ones they may not need.","John Chasteen was an amazing professor. He keeps the material interesting. The reading isn't overwhelming and he does take attendance. Your TA will be a huge contributor to your grade. There were papers, which weren't too bad, and tests are essay.","Excellent professor.  A pleasure to learn from."],"courses":["HIST143","HIST143","HIST143","HIST143","HIST143","HIST143","HIST143","HIST533","HIST395","HIST143","HISTMANY"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
