Makes the lectures easy to understand and has a good sense of humor. The exam was a beast though... Two essay questions plus a few short answers.","I went into this course with an open mind, but it was hard to find anything good about it. The readings were incredibly long and boring, but they rarely ever connected to class. I honestly don't know what we did in class most days. Also Prof. MacNeil is very condescending and intimidating at times. Overall, bad experience. Don't do it.","She is a good teacher if you actually attend class and listen to her lectures. Take notes and you will do fine on the exams. She even gives extra credit options on the final exam. Glad I attended class!","Worst teacher I have ever had. In my life. There were 8 papers that you had to stay up and write cause you can only rent the CDs for 24 hours. The papers are then graded on grammatical errors rather than information and the average grade is a C or D on them. Ended up failing the course. Words cannot express how bad a teacher she is","She is a terrible teacher for this class, half the class is presentations which are utterly boring and useless. Her grading scale is &quot;a diving score&quot; (umm..what&#63;) and while you are probably going to get an A, it is totally not worth the effort you have to put in. DONT TAKE ITTTTTT.","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! DO ANYTHING TO GET OUT OF IT NOW! The whole class is about OPERAS in ITALIAN and you never know what she is talking about. She has a bad attitude and pretends to care about students. FYS should be an easy A but she plays favorites. WORST experience of my life, I regret it everyday. Seriously. Drop this class and RUN AWAY.","I'm kind of shocked by all the low ratings. I thought the class was great. It's definitely an easy A, but her lectures are engaging and I feel like we learned a good bit. She has an off-the-wall sense of humor that keeps you awake. Recommended.","All seniors. Watch five operas and she beats them all into the ground. 3 grades (midterm, final, attendance). Tests were really easy and straightforward (you just spit back what she has talked about and know the librettists, composers, time periods, etc). Book is a waste to buy. She has a bizarre sense of humor but is otherwise okay. Easy A!","It's titled music on stage and screen but its really just opera. Very boring material, very boring teacher, very boring class. One ten page paper and one presentation more or less determine your grade but everyone gets As. Wouldn't take it again, even for the A","She's interested in the material, but doesn't make it clear all the time. The workload is heavy and time consuming until you figure out how to write papers for her. I didn't find her extremely personable. Don't even bother studying for her quizzes. The class average on them was usually around a 50 or below. For music majors only.","I had her for a freshman seminar and i think everyone got an A, which was based on 2 grades all year.  I'm not a huge fan of her though.","I enjoyed Dr. MacNeil's class so much!  She's knowledgeable and makes learning fun, plus she has a great sense of humor.","run away. run away NOW.","An absolutely awful course with a ridiculous workload of about one four page essay a week, sometimesmore than one.  Essays are based on points with terms and  ideas she wants you to have, not the content of your paper and your ideas.  Don't take this course with her.","I really loved McNeil's class and had a lot of fun with it.  She's one of the best teachers I've had at UNC!","The most pointless class I ever took, I learned nothing, and some days she didn't even show for class.","Likes to make students feel like they must be her friend outside of class in order to do well in class.  Needs to learn how to separate work from the outside world."],"courses":["MUSC287","MUSC89H","MUSC251","MUSC251","MUSC63","MUSC63","MUSC287","MUSC287","MUSC063","MUSC251","MUSC063","MUSC287","MUSC51","MUSC51","HONORS006K","COUNTERPOINT","MUSC"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
