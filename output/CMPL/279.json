Gives excellent feedback on papers and his lectures are brilliant.  Can't wait to take another class with him.","His lectures are really long and dragged out. He uses confusing and complicated diction and unnecessary comments. I learned most from recitation (recommend Melanie Ungar if she's still there). One group project, a few short papers, and two exams (midterm and final). MUST DO THE READINGS!!","Fantastic professor. Welcoming but somewhat intimidating in office hours: he doesn't just hand stuff to his students. Overall, the best class and professor I have had so far at Chapel Hill. He really knows his stuff, including topics that it seems wouldn't be his main field. Excellent feedback on papers. Careful, precise, and flexible instructor.","Sat in front of the room and had a conversation with the other prof, mostly about how difficult the subject material was. Made no effort to make the material understandable. If you visited him in his office, even with an appointment, he practically pushed you out the door as soon as you walked in. Has NO interest in helping struggling students.","Eric Downing is the reason I am a comparative literature major.  He is EXCELLENT!!!","Professor Downing was by far the best literature teacher I've had at UNC.  I loved his verbosity!","he can be a bit verbose, but the assignments were easy and he was very helpful and easy to get in contact with."],"courses":["CMPL478","CMPL279","CMPL450","CMPL295","CMPL121","COMPLIT51","CMPL51"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
