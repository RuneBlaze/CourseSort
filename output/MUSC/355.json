The only thing is the class was only offered early in the mornings and sometimes it's hard to stay awake. His lectures can be a little dry but it's easy to get engaged when familiar music samples are played. Figueroa also doesn't grade tough at all and is really easy to talk to. Definitely loves what he does","Awesome teacher and awesome class! All you really need to do is go to class, stay awake, and participate every now and then. Lectures are fascinating and you can really learn a lot."],"courses":["MUSC148","MUSC148"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
