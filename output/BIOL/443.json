He assigns a lot of primary literature to read, but does so in way that is not overwhelming. By the end of the semester you will be amazed at how well you are able to read and interpret scientific papers. Tests are very straightforward. He goes at a nice pace and explains concepts very well."],"courses":["BIOL443"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
