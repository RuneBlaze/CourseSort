The course material doesn't exactly lend itself to fascination, but Kurzman is clear and explains exactly what you need to know. The exams aren't bad as long as you listen to his instructions and they are open book so be sure to take notes verbatim. He is great.","I guess he hasn't taught this in a few years, but he must've gotten better because he is AMAZING. Generally this would be a super boring course, but Kurzman makes it simple, clear and to the point. He grades kind of hard, but it willing to work with you. Learned so much, which I needed as a soci major.","I loved this class. The subject matter can seem obscure at times (Foucault, Haraway, etc) but Kurzman's lectures are engaging and clear. However, the TA's were painfully out of sync with the material. As long as you do all the work, an A is guaranteed. Definitely worth it.","No Comments","No Comments","No Comments","Interesting guy, but I found the class boring and a lot of petty work.  The service learning compenent made the class interesting, but added greatly to the time I put into it.  Definitely need to keep up on the reading and be very involved in class.  Our class was too big to have good projects/teach class/discuss as we were supposed to.","Do the readings and you're ok!

A majority of the grade is the midterm and final, both of which are extremely difficult. He makes the answer choices all the same, and manages to have grammatical errors everywhere. This was harder than MATH 231 or CHEM 102.

She warms up to her students and really cares about them learning as much as possible. You have to do the reading, which is sometimes a lot, but there is no final and the whole grade is based off of the paper you work on throughout the semester in groups. I loved this class!","Professor Tyson was by far the most passionate prof. I had my freshman year. Her class was difficult and she expected a lot out of her freshman but she is really not as scary as she seems and cares about her students and their success.","This class was very engaging and discussion-based. The reading was required, but interesting. Tyson is brilliant. However, she is a bit inaccessible. You have to put in quite a bit of effort to build any sort of relationship. Also, she will not respond to emails that she does not think are important, which is very frustrating and a bit rude.","Professor Tyson is really great. At first, she is extremely intimidating but as the semester goes on she is very friendly and works well with the students. She genuinely cares about improving students writing and works with you to improve. The class material is very interesting but be sure to do the reading ahead of time.","Her first year seminar on equality of educational opportunity is really interesting with a light workload at first that steadily increases to a HUGE workload by the end of the semester. Professor Tyson is pretty intimidating, but incredibly brilliant and helpful if you just seek her out yourself. Always do the readings and come prepared to talk.","She seems super scary on the first day, but she eventually warms up. Definitely go to every class and take all the quizzes - they are fine if you do the readings and have an opinion. Bad with email and ignores what she doesn't want to deal with. See the TA for help with the final paper, and things surprisingly work out! Was happy with my grade.","She's a really tough teacher, but not so bad once you get to know her. Go to the quizzes, study and do the readings and you will be fine. She's pretty engaging though the intensity wears out by the end of the semester. The final is super short and easy because of the paper.","Weekly quizzes graded 0, 5 or 10.  She's very picky with the answers she accepts so most people get fives. There's also a 15 page paper at the end and an apples requirement.Its not an easy class but its worth the work. She's very passionate and knows her stuff. She's very good at engaging her students.She seems intimidating, but shes actually nice."],"courses":["SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI64","SOCI064","SOCI423","SOCI423","SOCI423"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
