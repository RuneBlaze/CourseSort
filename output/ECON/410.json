Her lectures are extremely engaging and she very clearly shows that she wants us to learn the material.

She makes the class more difficult than it needs to be (the homeworks) but rewards you later with relatively easy tests and midterms. The recitations are optional and helpful about 50% of the time. The Besanko problems are very helpful for the homeworks and the tests.","Excellent teacher. Knows her stuff and cares about it, along with her students.  But beware: if econ does not come naturally to you, you will have to work. A lot. Multiple choice questions are hard and account for half of each test (missing two brings you down a full letter grade). But overall she's an effective teacher despite harsh grading.","This is one of my favorite classes I've taken because the professor is great at teaching. Every word she says is important, so pay attention in class. She's strict and intimidating, but gives you the tools to be successful. She is very knowledgable and is great at breaking down concepts. The exams and homework are tough, but I've learned so much!","Dr. Sheran-Andrews is one of the best professors I've ever had.  She makes what could be dry material interesting and is always willing to explain a concept further if it doesn't make sense. Lectures are interesting and crystal clear. Tests are tough but not impossible.  She's also really funny! Take her class and you won't regret it!","Econ 410 with Sheran-Andrews was okay. She's decent at explaining material and her exams aren't impossible, but I wouldn't take a class with her again. Her office hours are very unhelpful and she doesn't provide much individual feedback. I wouldn't recommend her, but it's not the end of the world if you end up in her class.","Hardest class I've ever taken so far. She is a very effective teacher, but her tests are very challenging.
