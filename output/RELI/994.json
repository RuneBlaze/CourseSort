He doesn't believe in tests so the final only counted as 5% of our grade. There are two easy papers and the TA was amazing as well. They both really cared and wanted the best for you. The readings can be tough but Todd explains them all in lecture. Not what you expect but an awesome class nonetheless!","I wish I could take it again! it was definitely unexpected because it was more anthropology than religion, but I still loved his class. He always kept me interested. I took this class as a freshman and it definitely opened my mind. He clearly explained the readings better than any other prof I've had.  Grades depend on TAs though","reli 236 & 140: Todd is absolutely one of my favorite professors at UNC. He's a little out there, but he respects his students and makes difficult concepts more clear. He's very approachable.  If you aren't interested in philosophy/religion you probably won't like the class; but it's easy to succeed if you follow the readings & put in some effort.","He is very invested in the material, although he focuses far more on religious theory than religious practice.  I had him for religion in America.  Has midterm and final papers rather than exams, and uses attendance quizzes.  Doesn't make you get the textbook, loads readings onto Sakai.","Hated this class. Worst class at Carolina because of Todd.  Disliked his spin on INTRODUCTION TO RELIGION AND CULTURE due to his Anthropology background. Very Atheist and publicized his views. Confusing lecturer- not what I expected at all. Wish I would have read reviews first. Even our readings were titled Anth, not Reli. Not a fan. Very unhappy.","Liked the class but it was nothing like I expected. Viewed as more of an anthro category instead of religion and talks about lots of abstract things that you have to be open minded to listen to such as possession by gods or magic.","Really interesting class. This dude knows what he's talking about. Be warned - this class isn't about religious practice, as I expected, but about the thought process behind religion.","Lectures are interesting and Todd is obviously engaged, but he also talks in circles and the content is not AT ALL what anyone comes into the class expecting.

My enthusiasm for the class really faded over time.","I've thoroughly enjoyed Professor Ambros' class. She integrates various media into her teaching style and we have excellent discussions. We definitely read, but I am grateful for her class because I have a much deeper understanding of how elements of Eastern religions affect Japanese modern culture today, and Eastern Religions in the world.","I don't know if Dr. Ambros has gotten better, or if the other raters just have unreasonable standards.  I like her, the class, and the subject matter.  She is very knowledgeable about Japanese religions.  She even helped me find research articles for a paper that I had to write for another class.  I definitely recommend her class!","Overall, the class was extremely easy.  Dr. Ambros was not a terrible teacher--she was actually quite a fascinating lady--but she was hard to follow in class.  I would recommend taking the class, but I would not recommend buying the textbook on Japanese religion.  You can find all of the information you need online.","Had her for FYS. Participation is a big thing. Otherwise, not too difficult a class. LOTS of reading on weird topics. She helps out with the final paper, so it's not too bad. She's not the most excitable of people though, but she's not a mean person. Never went to office hours, so I don't know if they are helpful.","It was an easy A, and it can fulfill a requirement. The responses were super easy to do, as were the group projects. Class time on the other hand was quite boring, and I had no idea what she was talking about half the time because she was spewing out random Japanese words all the time. And don't bother buying the Sommers book, it's useless.","Class - fascinating, teacher - awful. Lectures - rambling, disjointed, trifling. I stopped going to class b/c it was a waste of time - the tests are wholly based on the reading, and while there's a lot, if you do most of it, you'll be fine.

Boy, did I learn about the New Testament in this class. This should not be a 100-level course. It was very tough and time consuming for an entry level class - but I learned a lot. Only take Reli 104 if you're seriously curious about it.","This class was one of my favorites thus far at UNC. Don't be fooled it does take A LOT of work and there are papers due each week; however, it was very interesting and I found that it really changed my personal views. The tests are really stressful (the midterm was 5 ID questions... there were over 200 words to study) but they are manageable.","Bart is extremely knowledgeable about his subject and seems to be passionate about teaching it. The course is definitely not easy. Reading and excessive note-taking is necessary. Tests are 150 word IDs on the midterm and IDs mixed with essays on the final. One of the hardest classes I've taken, but an A is possible if you study (a lot).","The comments for this professor are outdated. He is much more difficult than he used to be. Great lecturer, interesting, and very accredited in scholarship of the New Testament. However, his tests are much more than just memorizing terms. I would suggest for Reli majors, but not for people looking for an A in a gen. ed","The class was extremely interesting and entertaining, and the textbook easy to read, but the class required more work than it was worth. One 2-page paper each week, ~40-50 pages of reading each week, a group debate project, & a final exam (10 key term ID's and 2 essays). It's difficult to get an A even if you do all the reading and assignments.","Very interesting professor.  One of UNC's best lecturers and the class is extremely well organized.  The exams consisted of memorizing the key terms in the textbook but if you do that, you are set.  Definitely would recommend","The BEST professor I have ever had at UNC. His classes aren't the easiest, but they're so interesting. Lectures are focused and he makes funny anecdotes here and there. Definitely take a class of his, you won't regret it!","The tests were basically just memorizing all the terms from the text book.... It was an okay class but too much reading for someone who doesn't really care for the subject.","I loved this class.  It was really interesting and I enjoyed going to it.  Ehrman, however, does put his bias into the class and the content he teaches.  He's a great speaker and a nice guy though.  The TAs are awesome!!!  I would suggest this class for people who are comfortable with their religious beliefs.","No Comments","hard class...it's pretty easy to figure out what Bart believes, and chances are, he'll tell you at the end of the semester...exams are ridiculous...you have to basically memorize the entire glossary of your textbook for the final. fairly predictable...great teaching style...but if you choose to share your thoughts, chances are they will be shot dow","Dr. Ehrman was one of my absolute favorite professors in college.  He's entertaining, interesting, open to respectful discussion of different points of view, accessible, and really seems to enjoy teaching. I was not a religion major; I just took the class as an elective and it turned out to be my favorite class all semester.  Highly recommend.","An interesting class, probably the most controversial I've been in. Covers a lot of good material and is an interesting, animated lecturer. Note: this is a history class so don't take it if you don't want to be memorizing tons of information! Final and midterm are difficult, but not too bad if you think about what you need to study.","I LOVED this class.  While it was hard, Ehrman is super interesting and he holds office hours at Armadillo Grill!  He explains the material pretty well and he has a fascinating biography.","one of the best professors i had in college - i actually went to his classes and like it.  and if you take his class - definitely attend the last day that is not mandatory - you'll want to hear his actual opinion instead of just the facts","A life changer if you are lost about things, and engaging if you aren't.  Goes out of his ways to keep personal views private and to respect yours.  Atheists, Agnostics, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus, Muslims, and Evangelical Christians alike could appreciate this man.","Ehrman has been my fave professor, hands down. He has a sarcastic sense of humor that I love and he is engaging and interesting. This is a teacher who makes you actually enjoy going to class. But, as someone else said, if you don't like your religious views challenged at all, don't take this class.","Great instructor.

The grading is really easy, it's all in two papers, 14 page-long journals and two quizzes. You can skip class and you'll be fine. The reading materials were really interesting to me, and so was recitation, so do those if you're interested in the subject matter.","Incredibly knowledgeable.

It feels like he skips over anything relevant. You have to write 14 journals, which are easy and you can do without reading but it's annoying. LOTS of reading. Two quizzes (study guides provided). Papers for exams.","Professor Ernst is a brilliant person and his lectures are used to highlight broad concepts. You do have to do the reading though; I got a lot more out of the class when I did it. And there are only a few assignments! If you want reliable background information on Islam, this is the course to take but you do have to have to have interest in it.","I really enjoyed this course. Ernst is one of the most knowledgeable professors i've had. There is a good bit of reading, but they're not terribly boring (I loved Following Muhammad). Like most classes you'll get out what you put in. If you never read or take notes and expect him to essentially write your paper in lecture, i'd skip this one.","I thought Intro to Islamic Civilization was an introductory course.  No.  Half the class dropped it or stopped attending lectures.  DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN ISLAMIC EDUCATION; If you do, you'll like his semi-discussion formatted lectures, and (only) 3 assignments (Weekly journals on reading; midterm and final paper).","The worst class I have ever taken!  It was so boring, and he rambled all class long.  He always took questions in lecture, which is usually good, but he was just so boring and rambled so much his answers never made sense.  Excessive reading assignments.  My TA was awful, too, and we had barely any assignments to boost (or earn) grades.","I'm blown away by this man.","i dropped this class because he was extremely boring and had no stucture. lectures were full of him talking very little about the subject and showing pictures from vacation in religious places. when it came time to write papers he expected us to pull things out of thin air since he didnt really teach. you have to teach yourself. 1 TA was mean!","No Comments","Professor Ernst is one of the most interesting and knowledgable people I've ever had the joy of learning from.

Ernsts book Following Muhammad would recommend to anyone. He teaches this class like a grad level course and the learning is on you. I thought the TA's graded the papers fairly and I scored poorly on one. Just put in the time.","Ernst is incredibly boring and his lectures are very unorganized. I couldn't really tell what the concepts were that he was trying to emphasize. The 4 essays we wrote, which are practically the only grades, were graded way too strictly.
