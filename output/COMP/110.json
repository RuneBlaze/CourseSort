By far one of my most favorite professors. His tests and projects arent easy, but if you go to office hours they will help you on the projects. He tries to help everyone succeed as long as you put in work. He is so funny and tries to relate to us. Definitely reccommend!!","Contrary to popular belief, this class isn't an easy A. The tests are difficult, but here's the thing: Kris is an amazing professor. If you go to class, go to office hours, and study, you will be fine. I can't believe how much I've improved since the start of the semester. I wish I could write more about how great Kris is. Would recommend his class","Kris is definitely one of the best professors at UNC. The tests are difficult but he knows that, and does anything to make sure that doing bad on them won't mess your grade up terribly in the end. He will replace your test averages if you do better on the final, which most people did. Go to office hours for help, and you'll get an A/B.","Unpopular opinion: this class is not easy or fun. Last semester everyone said it would be a fun easy A, and I need it for my Psyc major so I took it. This semester he turned around and made it really hard. I went to office hrs, I went to class and I still did not understand. Dont do it if you dont have to, or wait till he has more experience.","Kris is a wonderful professor. He is the only person that I have felt is good enough for me to take the time to get on here and rate him. The tests in his class are no joke, but the final could, and did, replace both of my lower midterm grades. He's super nice and really entertaining and seems to care about if the students are actually learning.","10/10 would recommend","Kris Jordan was easily my favorite professor of the semester, and probably will still be my favorite by the time I graduate. I cannot recommend him enough. He has inspired me to commit to the computer science major. As for the class, expect a challenge. He will be there for you to help you succeed; however, he wants to see you put forth the work.","Kris is a great teacher. He makes a bland and somewhat confusing topic interesting. There were 2 midterms and 6 problem sets. Problem sets are time consuming but there are office hours galore.","Kris is awesome!!! He is a nice guy who really cares about students and CS. BUT the tests absolutely killed me this semester. The problem sets were easy but I felt like the exam questions were WAY harder and I didn't feel prepared for them. The study guides he gave us were super easy and then I'd go to take the test feeling all confident and NOPE","Amazing professor. Informative and fun class. This is coming from a non-CS major with no prior programming experience. 'Nough said.","Great professor! Really seems to care about everyone in the class and has a passion for Computer Science. The work load is not to intense and the problem sets are actually fun and interesting. If you put in the effort, an A is easily obtainable. 10/10 would recommend.","Kris is definitely one of the best professors I met! He loves his job and his students and has a sense of humor; the lectures and the projects are interesting, and he really offers lots of help to ensure you could get a good grade. If he teaches another course I will take it without hesitation.","Kris is very fun and cares a lot about his students. He even convinced me to be a COMPSCI major. Our assignments included making NCAA brackets, computer games, and magic 8 balls. While the tests are tough, the grade is heavily dependent on the problem sets which are easy to get a 100 on if you are willing to go to office hours.","Kris is literally the best professor that I have ever had.  Even though he teaches this huge lecture class, he tries to get to know you, which is just really cool.  At times the material can be tough, but if you go to class and use the resources that Kris provides (recitations and office hours) you'll  do great.","Great professor, great class","Kris Jordan was one of my favorite professors I've had so far at UNC. I came into this class with no computer science experience at all, and left feeling like I had learned a lot. The lectures are fun and interactive. I definitely recommend going to office hours if you get stuck, those helped me a lot.","His assignments are cool. It does well to garner interest. The students manipulate programs that he created and then the hw deals with adding interactivity with lessons learned in class. My biggest issue is that I have friends in 110 who ask me for help on the most basic of questions. I think he needs to assure the basics are understood before 401","Best teacher Ive had in 4 semesters at UNC","He really cares about his students and is more than willing to meet you halfway.  Plus he's actually a pretty funny guy. 10/10 Would take again.","Best professor at UNC. Does an excellent job engaging students of every major and works to make programming accessible to everyone. 10 out of 10 would recommend. It takes work and is not like any other subject, but Kris will work with you and office hours are very helpful."],"courses":["COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110","COMP110"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"COMP","catalog_nbr":110,"section":2,"class_nbr":10413,"title":"INTRO PROGRAMMING","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Carroll","room":"0111","days":"TuTh","time":"11","instructor":"Jordan,Kristopher Scott","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":410,"enrl_tot":403,"wait_cap":40,"wait_tot":25,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2057674","fname":"Kristopher","lname":"Jordan","quality":"4.7","easiness":"2.1","help":"2.1","clarity":"2.1","topTag":"Hilarious (22)","grade":"2.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["HILARIOUS","TOUGH GRADER","HILARIOUS","SKIP CLASS?
