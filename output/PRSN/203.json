It was basically an easy A, but I know some who didn't study or participate in class who did not fare as well as they should have.","This was a third year Persian Farsi class and it was great. The small class size allowed for more time practicing the language and Dr. Adel is very helpful in improving all modalities of the language. Dr. Adel is very good at teaching Persian Farsi and I highly recommend taking her language and cultural courses."],"courses":["ASIA122","ASIA490"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
