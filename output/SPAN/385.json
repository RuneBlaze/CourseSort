He's a little hard to get a read on, one minute he'll be laughing and joking and the next he'll be summoning you to his office to tell you you don't talk enough in class.","Emilio is such a nice guy. He's very laid back, but he expects you to take the class seriously. He calls on people who don't raise their hands, so be sure to do the reading. He's really cool and has a great relationship with his students.","Great class, awesome professor, I would highly recommend.","My best suggestion is to simply agree with whatever he says and do not disagree with anything. Any original thought or opinion that is not in agreement with his will be overruled and be misconstrued as you not properly understanding the text. His grading and expectations are unclear and he is rarely prepared for class.","Laid-back, friendly dude who definitely keeps things interesting.  Not a class for people who want to just slide by, but great for anyone who wants a different perspective.  He's a lot of fun."],"courses":["SPAN373","SPAN373","SPANISH205","SPAN625","SPAN398"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
