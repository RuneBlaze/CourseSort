Her depth of knowledge and encouragement for all her students is simply amazing. I hated English and the Humanities, and after taking two classes with her, she has instilled a new love for English and the Humanities in me. You need to take at least one class with her at UNC.","Very student friendly, but also knowledgeable beyond just in English. It's a fun class to take, but you should be ready to spare time for readings.","All around great teacher. The class was super easy. In the beginning of the year she told us that the way the grades worked, we could skip every recitation (which was simply a reading quiz and open discussion) and still pass with an A. She was really good with extra credit, and I never really had to read a burdensome amount. No tests ever.","SHE IS AWESOME. A must-have at UNC. Science major, history major, english major-- whoever you are, from whatever walk of life, this is the place to be. Don't miss out.","Even though it was just a seminar, Prof. Thrailkill was awesome! She is a little unorganized, and I don't think a normal english class with her would be necessarily easy, but she is an amazing professor and clearly has a passion for English.  A lot of reading, but can get away with not doing it all.","Do not give up a chance to take a class with this amazing professor. She is brilliant, funny, warm, engaging, and she obviously loves what she does. ENGL 268 is easily one of the best classes at UNC -- and I'm a science major, not an English major. Seriously -- make sure you have a class with her before you leave UNC.","She is fabulous! So ridiculously smart--take her class! She's great to talk to one-on-one, and she's great with a big class. Discussion is always awesome. I love love loved this class.","Professor Thrailkill is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. She gives great insight into the readings and really values students' input. She wants you to understand the material, and cares that you do. She will never make a student feel dumb for volunteering in class and is a very fair grader.","Prof Thrailkill is one of the best professors I've ever had. Her lectures are clear and interesting. Reading was usually one short story per class, which was manageable, and essay grading was fair. She's also really nice and helpful outside of class. Oh - she learned all our names, and it was a big class! Take her, you won't be sorry!","She is the BEST professor I have ever had - hands down. I went into her class as a science major, pretty much hating all lit classes. She was so helpful throughout the semester, and she has new ways of looking at the readings that are so awesome and refreshing. When the class was over I was an English major, and that pretty much says it all.","She is amazing!  One of the best professors I've had at UNC.  I took this class after reading previous reviews on RateMyProfessor and I am SO glad I did!","The epitome of pure genius.  Honest to God, I look forward to coming to this class...her lectures are fantastic and her grasp of the material is amazing.  If this class were three hours long, each and every day, I would gladly attend.  She's a fair grader and an excellent professor...if you can take her, do.","she is amazing! her lectures are so interesting! and she is such a sweetheart and a huge help outside of class!","Professor Thrailkill is great!  Her class is very fun; we watch videos a lot.
