He stimulates class discussion very well and encourages participation. He is approachable and friendly. His office door is always open to students with questions, although he expects to answer a substantive question, not to rehash or explain the basic law.","Great class. Exactly what I expected from law school. I look forward to taking him again in the future.","Not always clear, not always helpful but what a great lecturer!","Class consists of nothing more than normative discussions about what the law should be.  Prof. Marshall is abrasive, sarcastic, and doesn't hide his disdain for students.
