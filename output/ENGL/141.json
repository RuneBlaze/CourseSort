He is an excellent lecturer who not only loves his jobs but truly cares about his students. He gives excellent feedback. Professor Cohen aims to make everyone in the class a more critical reader and efficient writer. I would love to take another class with Professor Cohen.","Would love to take again.  Great lectures.  Participation is a must, but discussion topics are interesting, so participating is not difficult.  Wonderful professor.  Gives excellent feedback, is always available to meet and discuss classwork, and will go out of his way to help.  Truly cares about his students and their success.  Chose great novels","Marc Cohen is GREAT!!!!!! He is so helpful (if you approach him), and he is very flexible. I sent him my weekly schedule and he found a time that would suit both of us. He helped me improve my writing so much!","He brought us Krispy Kreme doughnuts. What more do you want? He is incredibly willing to help students by giving feedback on papers before they are due. He genuinely wants all of his students to do well and improve their writing.","He's the bomb. Bought us donuts at the end too.","Dr. Cohen is really helpful in office hours. He really makes himself as available as possible for his students. He gives amazing feedback on papers. The books were interesting and he led great discussions.","Prof. Cohen is one of my favorite professors I've had! He really cares about his students and takes time to get to know you. He is always so willing to help and really wants you to improve your writing in his class, which you definitely will. Definitely go see him in office hours, he'll tell you exactly what he wants to see in your writing.","Professor Cohen is a solid teacher. He is always in a good mood and excited to teach class. For our exams, we had to write essays and short answers, but he literally gives you exactly what is going to be on the test beforehand. He's really happy when you speak up in class or even just stay to talk a bit after class. Great experience overall!","Prof. Cohen goes above and beyond to help students. Your grade will be influenced by how much you utilize this help but he's very fair and the grading contract really helps.","Super awesome Professor, extremely helpful, my favorite professor yet","amazing professor! he goes out of his way to help you but his grades are based on how much you've improved so its a little difficult if you are a good writer but he really is awesome and if you do all your work then a moderately easy A.","Very helpful and interested in this subject.  Grading contract makes it east to get at least a B+.","The class is a lot harder if you are a skillful writer. He grades based on improvement, so if you don't have a lot to improve on at a 101 level, you're pretty much screwed.","At first, he it seems as if he will be a very helpful and insightful professor. However, as the semester wears on, it becomes evident that he establishes impossible standards for his students. He also puts a large amount of emphasis on personal preference. If he does not like a student for any reason, it will be very difficult to get a good grade.","Even though I have only attended UNC for one full year, Professor Cohen is the best professor that i have had thus far and will be tough to beat by any other professor in the future.  He was always willing to meet with you outside of class, which was a huge help for me.  After having Professor Cohen for two semesters, I can guarantee you that the grade you get for the class will reflect the effort that you put into it.  I highly reccomend that you take his class if you have the opportunity.","overall great teacher","He is very approachable. I got help before writing all of my papers and I think my writing skills improved greatly thanks to his guidance. Also, he's just a generally nice person!","he's vary pasionate","Good teacher.","Good teacher."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL123","ENGL123","ENGL105","ENGL129","ENGL141","ENGL145","ENGL124","ENG105","ENGL123","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENGL102","ENGL121","ENG12","ENG102","ENG102"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
