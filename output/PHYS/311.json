He isn't the clearest lecturer, but he's decent.  His tests are mostly concepts based, the calculations aren't hard, but the test average was still low.  They test that you get the big picture.  He curves and will bump you up if he sees you at office hours."],"courses":["PHYS117"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
