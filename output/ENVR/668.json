He presents the material to make it interesting, & class is usually very entertaining. Exams are pretty fair.","This professor is terrible. He's difficult to understand as well as extremely unorganized. The class didn't follow the syllabus at all. He is rude and constantly interrupts his students to correct them on objective and irrelevant details. If you have a class with him, get out while you still can. He is the worst professor I've ever had."],"courses":["MATH528","MATH51"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
