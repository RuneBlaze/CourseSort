Textbook (Bretscher) was useless so you'll probably need to refer to other textssources. His lectures weren't helpfulengaging, I basically self-studied this class. Gives large amounts of HW especially during weeks of tests. First test was easy but the second test and final were much, much harder.","I'm only a freshman, but by far the hardest class I've ever taken. I thought I was good at math, then I took this class. By the end of the semester it mostly makes sense, but during it I was never more lost.","This is one of the best teachers I have had, going out of his way to help you individually if he knows you're trying hard. He is NOT the right teacher for everyone. Be prepared to exhaust the material before class, in order to benefit from his brilliance. He can teach very fast, but will slow down and explain things clearly if you ask him to.","I have had Professor Kumar before for Math 233. There is no doubt, his tests are very stressful. However, he spends a great amount of time making sure students know each section very well and is always helpful when students have questions. He asks questions in class, so if students don't understand, he will notice and help correct this.","Very nice professor.  His accent is difficult to understand at first, but you'll get the hang of it.  The quiz questions come directly from the homework, but the tests are what killed my grade in this class.  He throws a bunch of curve balls at you.  This ended up being my lowest grade at UNC.","He was a very nice man, but he was not clear at all. His tests were extremely difficult. There was no room for mistakes. Unless you are a math whiz, I would not suggest taking him, because you will recieve insufficient help.","No Comments","No Comments"],"courses":["MATH547","MATH547","MATH681","MATH577","MATH383","MATH33","MATH033","MATH101"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE"]}}]
