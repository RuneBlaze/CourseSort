However, although they are stressful, it gets considerably better as the semester goes on because you do get more used to them. As far as learning the material, he is excellent. He's always willing to help as well!","Stressful entrance and exit quizzes that constitute 50% of your grade are a pain in the ass, especially when he doesn't drop the lowest quiz grade. He is a good lecturer but the subject is boring. I put very little effort into this class and there is not much homework but I got a B. You have to pay attention and work hard for an A.","Don't walk. Run away from Carlstein. He makes STOR155 so much harder and more stressful than it needs to be and every day there is an entrance and exit quiz that give you panic attacks. If you need help I hope you like waiting 2 hours. I did better and felt less stressed in MATH233","Best Professor for STOR155. Always available to answer questions; very good explanations and examples in class.","He gives entrance and exit quizzes at the beginning of each lecture which can be a bit tricky. Overall, he's very clear and teaches well. The final was very easy if you apply yourself throughout the class.","We had entrance and exit quizzes every class. If you are quick with equations and able to perform in stressful situations, you will do fine in this class. As others have mentioned below, don't be fooled by how easy the lecture material and homeworks are. The daily quizzes require you to expand your knowledge of the material. Attend office hours!","Everyone I've talked to in my STOR 555 class agreed that Carlstein is the best professor we've had at UNC. His tests were very difficult, but his lectures are fantastic, and he structures the class in such a way that one topic flows naturally to the next. Every other STOR class I've taken makes more sense because I took his class.","Professor Carlstein is definitely one of the best professors I have ever had, not only at UNC, but my entire college life. His extremely thorough and explicit explanation makes the material easy to understand. If you follow his lecture closely, there is no problem of getting A. Yet, he doesn't do curve or extra credit. So, lazy kids need to pass.","Test questions were insanely tricky and he did not curve 30 question exams. You miss 7 which really isn't very hard to do even if you know the material and you end up with a C.","This class was one of the worst that I have taken since being at UNC. Carlstein is a good teacher, but there is 1-2 hours of homework on a nightly basis and his tests are created to make the simplest of material extremely hard. I highly recommend finding a different teacher if you have to take stats.","Boring class, but he teaches it well. You don't have  Very thorough and straight forward. If you attend the tutoring session, you will do one hundred times better. He gives you plenty of chances to do well. But don't expect an easy A by any means. Its a tough class.","Carlstein is an excellent large-class lecturer. If you know something about statistics before taking STOR 155, his class will bore you to tears, but Carlstein does know what he is doing. His tests contain many trick questions, but if you pay attention, this is a very easy class to ace. Some other STOR155 sections are taught by incomprehensible TAs.","Good class, good prof. Intro to stats can be a bit boring, but thats just how it is. But Carlstein was enthusiastic about teaching it and clearly knew his stuff: he didnt make any mistakes AT ALL during class, which is very impressive given all those numbers and datasets. Not nearly as hard as people say he is...just pay attention and review notes.","Class seems easy, but beware. Even though I made an A, his tests are hard. PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION to what the question is asking, and be sure that your answer is the best answer based on what the question asks. At times it almost seems like he wanted people to trip up...pretty much what is said below. He is a good teacher, though.","I agree with what was said below -- the class seems like it should be easy, but the tests kill your grade.  I went to every class, did all the homeworks and still did horribly on all the tests. Kills any desire to work for the grade.","This class is a lot more difficult than it should be.  there are two main points of difficulty: 1. the tests.  They're absurd.  I don't know anyone who got an A on either of  the midterms.  I hope you like B's.  2. staying awake in class.  It's stultifying.  Bring the crossword.","he's ridiculous. the material is deceitfully easy, the homework is as well, but when you take his tests, which are all multiple choice, they are impossible. he doesn't care how hard you work, you get the grade you get and that's it. he doesn't drop anything. he's willing to answer your questions, but i'm not sure he's all that helpful.","tests were impossible to pass and he never dropped the lowest homework grade out of 30 assignments. and the kid looked like he didnt own an iron.","tests are difficult, but he's a pretty good professor and tries to liven up class, bringing dice to class to demonstrate randomness, etc.","Ever felt really confident on what you knew on a subject just to have the test be none of that. Carlstein teaches one thing, and tests another, your ability to figure him out. The tests are insane  and homework due every class doesn't help with any kind of joy for this class. I suggest staying away."],"courses":["STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR555","STOR555","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STAT155","STAT155","STAT155","STAT155","STAT031","STAT31","STAT31","STAT31"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
