Her lectures are long but very interesting, and all the material you need for the test and more is described in lecture.  Go to class and take notes and you'll do well!","The only reason I took this class was bc I heard it was an easy A, but they had to CURVE the first exam. I think she got hard after the scandal. Was harder than my Bio 202 class No help at all-- she won't even acknowledge someone who has their hand raised in the front row Doesn't allow technology but talks fast and doesn't post ppts or outlines","Magness is cool, but your grade depends on your TA, and if you need help, you go to them. Magness just lectures and makes the assignments. 3 midterms with 6 identifications and an essay. All given ahead of time. Term paper is tough because the lectures and tests cover different material. NOT AN EASY A. Lectures are mostly about history.","TAs are very inconsistent with grading. There is A LOT of memorization but you're only tested on a couple terms so you still have to study everything. It is clear she is passionate about her subject. To me, she made this boring subject as interesting as it possibly could. GO TO CLASS and take DETAILED notes, including DATESNAMES.","Jodi Magness is the most boring lecturer I've ever had.  She is an elitist who will not tolerate opinions that go against hers.  Her TA's were very inconsistent and they decide your grade as they grade your exams and papers and make your quizzes.  This class was as miserable as it gets.  NEVER TAKE THIS CLASS","A complete waste of a first year seminar- this class was incredibly boring and the daily essays made students feel as though they were imbeciles for not knowing about toilets in 30BC. Do not recommend.","This is a terrible class. Do not be swindled into being convinced that this is an easy A. Worst class I've taken at Carolina, period. Boring and entirely lecture-based, with extreme variations on grades that are entirely dependent on the TA you get. Don't take this class, it's not worth whatever gen ed credits you're trying to get.","This class in NOT an easy A.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you aren't good at essay writing or history.","Jodi is brilliant. Her class was one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken. Her lectures are well planned and you will learn a lot. She is an expert in her field and talks about her own experiences. She does talk fast, so you have to write down things quickly. Her tests were short ID's and essays, which she gives in advance. Great Prof.","Amazing professor, she does a great job of making all of the lectures interesting. Very experienced in her field of work, so she knows what she's talking about. She doesn't put the notes online so you can't skip lecture without having a friend to get them from. The TAs vary in difficulty but they're fine- I had the hardest one and managed an A-.","This class was supposed to be an easy A.  It wasn't for me.  She is great!  Her lectures were interesting and she gave us the pictures for the ids and the essays before the tests.  Your grade depends on your TA.  I got a B-...","She was probably the best professor I had this semester. She kept the class entertaining. The exams were not to bad, the TAs didnt grade too harshly, and she even offered extra credit opportunities. The hardest part of her class was the 7-8 page term paper due before the thanksgiving break, so if you dont procrastinate on this then youll do fine.","This was a grad/undergrad course, and my major is far outside of the religious studies department. That being said, i found the seminar style class to be interesting and Jodi is very bright and well rehearsed in the subject matter. We did presentations which I did really well on, and then had a 10 pg paper-DONT SCREW UP CITATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","fun","I. Love. Jodi. Magness. She is by far one of the most interesting professors I've had at Carolina. Her test questions come straight from class, so you can't miss it, but it makes them easy (you get the essay &#63;'s ahead of time). The books basically reiterate class lecture so you don't really have to read. Recitation attendance is mandatory.","Great class, better teacher. She goes incredibly fast but makes ancient religious study very interesting. Tests are ID's and essays given in advance. Normally gives oppertunity for extra credit and a large portion of the final grade is easy recitation attendance.","Great class Great Professor. Incredibly interesting!  Im looking forward to having her again next semester!","As long as you can keep up, this class is great","One of my favorite professors!","Lecture was boring and she packs a lot of info into each lecture. I had to study a bit to keep all the names and dates straight, but I never had to do any of the reading except for what was assigned for recitation. The tests came straight from lecture and with or without the GENEROUS extra credit, I easily got an A!"],"courses":["RELI110","RELI106","RELI110","RELI106","RELI106","RELI63","RELI106","RELI106","RELI110","RELI106","RELI110","RELI106","RELI512","RELI106","RELI106","RELI106","BIBLICALARCH","RELI24","RELI2428","RELI24"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"CLAR","catalog_nbr":994,"section":40,"class_nbr":1885,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"HAGGIS,DONALD C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":4,"enrl_tot":4,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=70024","fname":"Donald","lname":"Haggis","quality":"2.8","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"SO MANY PAPERS (1)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SO MANY PAPERS"],"comments":["Professor Haggis tends to give very confusing, long, and rambling lectures. However, if you come to class and actively attempt to take good notes, you can do really well (A) in his class. The problem is that 90% of people think that this class is a joke. If you don't pay attention and don't do the readings before exams, you'll get low grades.","Oh wow where do I start. First off, I will say, he is a nice guy and I'm sure he means well. But man, it was honestly the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. Class never had anything to do with anything. The final might has well been in a foreign language as half of the stuff was so foreign to me even though I never missed a class.","I honestly went to the class the first week and a half, for the midterm, and for the final. It's absolutely unbearable, don't bother going. And everyone else found it easy, but I disagree. His tests are annoyingly over tricky. I read the entire course pack and still bombed the final. Avoid this class like the plague.","I barely went to class before the midterm and got a 90, didn't go at all except to turn in my paper and got a good grade on the paper and final and got an A in the class. Really easy class, and you don't ever have to go","Prof. Haggis does nothing but ramble and laugh at random things he says. Don't bother going to class. For the midterm I studied just the course pack and made a decent grade. Stopped paying attention after that and passed with a B+ by studying the course pack and group study guide (he doesn't give one).","He rambles for the entire lecture and rarely finishes his thought process. Also we are always behind because he cant lecture clearly","Professor Haggis is a fun teacher and has a great sense of humor.  In class, he can occasionally ramble, but he gets to the point and teaches what you need to know to do well on tests.  I recommend doing your reading, except for Biers, that's pretty boring stuff.  Apply yourself and you'll do well.","This class is truly the worst thing I have ever taken.  He rambles in lecture and just talks about all of his projects.  Course pack was helpful.  Stay home and read the book and course pack.","This class made me want to die every day. His lectures had no structure- he used the same powerpoint of pictures all semester and rambled. He never once took attendance (odd for a FYS) and so didn't know our names, and the only assignments were a midterm paper and two final papers, so there was little room for mistakes. Not worth the requirements!","sorry..but he's boring. notes from class are important though.  use the books to fill out the study guides (yes, even the short answer portions-just vocab won't do you much good) the day before the exam and cram.  you should be fine.","take notes in class and read/skim through the course pack once or twice and you'll be fine. the tests are multiple choice and very very easy. he's an interesting lecturer as well.","Ancient Cities- Just study the Course Pack for the first half of the semester (when Donald teaches). My notes never made sense. Beth Greene taught the second half- go to class to take notes on her PowerPoints. Tests are fine as long as you study a lot. Do whatever extra credit is offered for sure, even if it means going to Duke for something!","I loved his lectures...I was also intrigued by his knowledge.  He is a really quirky guy, but also very nice.  I came when office hours had just ended once to speak to him and we ended up having a 2 hour chat.  Great guy. Awesome prof. Easy tests. Take it.","Hmm","Yes, he can be a little boring in the lectures at times but if you listen to what he's saying he obviously knows a lot, and on top of that the tests are very easy.  If you listen in class and read all of the material it's one of the easiest classes you can take here.","Oh my God! (I'm Atheist) but, anyway...Donald isn't boring at all - - I never slept in any of his classes.  Clar 375 was one of my favorites classes at UNC (so interesting) and he still the best teacher at UNC for me - - he knows everything.","He is very cute! He is one of the best professors that I ever had :) by Habib.","...everything said in the class is there, in the books. The pictures/slides that he show to us \r are amazing  - - they are the only thing that Donald needs to use as a guide to keep his \r lectures going on. For the exams, just come to the class (attendance is important) and, \r study the exam guide  review sheet. I really enjoyed take Clar 375 (Spri","Everyone else mentions how boring he can be.  But his tests were horrible.  You could memorize everything we read and still not know 1/2 the questionsWent to talk to him once and he wouldn't even look at me, barely said a word.  **** says he gives 9% A/A-, which is lower than the hardest chem classes. more than 30% get a C in clar20/120.
