She really knows her stuff and is a great professor overall. Don't expect an easy A, or even B though.","Great professor, can't wait to take more classes with her. Very low homework requirements, and midterm/final papers are easy to write with her help. Professor Brown is always flexible in arranging office hours that best fit your schedule. Very helpful, and extremely knowledgeable on the subject. If you need a PHIL credit, take this class."],"courses":["PHIL384","PHIL170"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
