I signed up for her class as an afterthought and became a Geography minor after one semester with her. I took another of her classes the next year because she was so great and I've never met a professor who cares more about what she does and about her students.","This class and Professor Olson are the reasons I decided to become a geography major. She is an excellent and thought-provoking lecturer. For a 100 level class this was more challenging than might be expected, but it was very worth it and the take away is incredible.","Professor Olson is one of the nicest, best, and most enthusiastic professors you will ever find. If you take an intro-level class with her (I had 125), be aware that it's just as difficult (if not more so) as her upper-level class. That being said I still did well in both classes, learned a TON, and absolutely loved every minute of class with her.","I was so excited to take this class, but Prof. Olson made the subject so much harder than what it could have been. Her tests were very hard and I never knew what exactly she was looking for. (Everything is written)","Way too difficult for an intro level class. I was a third year geography major when I took this class and I was well versed in the subject, but the tests even went over my head a couple times. Not an easy grader, slightly condescending, but you will likely learn a decent amount in this class if you really invest in it."],"courses":["GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG424","GEOG125","GEOG130"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":691,"section":3,"class_nbr":8160,"title":"HONORS COURSE","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"SMITH,SARA H","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1860553","fname":"Sara","lname":"Smith","quality":"4.1","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Get ready to read (1)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["Smith is very passionate about geography and knows a lot. She is nice and easy to talk to. We had a unit on the Black Lives Matter movement and it was included on a test we had on class material- which I thought was rather subjective. She is v opinionated on things and sometimes it is overbearing. Should keep political opinions off of class tests","Sara is an amazing teacher and person, I absolutely loved going the her class. Though the class is quite bias towards liberal ideas the class discusses both sides of the issue. The papers were very interesting and not difficult at all. I HIGHLY recommend first years to take this course.","Great professor. Workload is manageable and exams are pretty easy. Very approachable and is always willing to help if you need it. Recommended!","Her lectures were not very clear and generally you're just fine if you view her ppts (which are online) and read the text book. I've already taken the class and I'm still not too sure what the class is even about. She's passionate, but not a great instructor. Pretty easy class. I failed one of the exams (due  to laziness) & still ended up w/ a B","Sara was a great professor. The lectures covered a lot of material, but you could tell that she was passionate about geography. Tests are hard, but projects help bring your grade up. To do well, you have to go to class and keep up with the reading!","Sara is the best. She's very passionate and helpful, and dedicated to explaining geographic concepts to those of us who aren't majors. Class was pretty straightforward, wasn't too hard, and the material was interesting. I would take another class with her!"],"courses":["GEOG120","GEOG89","ASIA267","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG267"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
