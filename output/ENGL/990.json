Extremely knowledgeable in his field, has a passion for literature that I've never seen before. He's a tough grader on essays, but let's you rewrite them.  There are readings for every class, but they're typically short.","Professor Reinert is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. My class was on 18th-Century British Literature, which sounds boring, but he made it so engaging. He always cracked witty jokes and tried his best to engage students with the material. I worried about this class because I'm not a fan of reading or history, but I loved it. I recommend.","While I wouldn't describe his class as an Easy A, Thomas teaches one of the most interesting classes I've taken and holds awesome class discussions with minimal lecturing.  He also brings a lot of his own personality into the classroom, which really made it come alive.  As for grading, he lets you re-write all the papers as many times as you want.","Highly Recommend!!!","Great teacher. His assigned books are interesting, and class discussion is lively and engaging. A really cool guy who wants you to do well both in his class and in life. I'm not really an &quot;english person&quot; but I couldn't help myself from speaking up in his class because unlike other english courses his is not intimidating and/or dull.","Funniest professor I've had at UNC, an absolute delightful class to attend. Professor Reinert truly wants you to succeed, and makes final as easy as possible. Three papers are the course workload, the first two you're allowed to rewrite until satisfied with your grade. Absolutely recommend.","GREAT TEACHER.  So funny and lovable.  Really cares what his students have to say.  Never puts down any ideas or opinions.  Learned everyone's name in the class.  Chose mostly amazing books to read and discuss.  Never was really much into required reading, but I really enjoy this class because of him.","A really good professor. He chose interesting books to read and did a good job focusing on key themes and interesting passages. The papers were easy and you could rewrite them. He really likes hearing alternative interpretations from different people and doesn't shut people down just because he disagrees. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!","he's the best professor i've had at unc. i love coming to class everyday, and he makes the material so interesting and...moving.  I know that sounds corny, but it's true.  He's a genius, he's hilarious, and he really tries to get to know the students as people.  TAKE HIS CLASS, you won't regret it.","he's awesome, very eccentric, and he makes even the boring material interesting.","He is a great professor! He made the material so interesting and I really enjoyed coming to class! I highly recommend him.(Also- he lets students re-write papers!)","Great professor! I looked forward to coming to his class every day. . . he's very humorous and eager to teach if you are willing to learn.","Excellent teacher...extremely funny, made material very interesting. Made it a point to know everyone's name and treat everyone like an individual. Allows paper rewrites too-it's hard not to get an A in the class if you do the reading, put in the effort, and contribute in class. Easily one of the best profs I've had...","funny guy who makes class ok, though it's all about poetry. the only grades are 3 papers and final but you can boost your grade by talking in class. you can re-write your papers too.  &quot;i think snoop dogg is amazing.&quot;","great, self depracating sense of humor.  genuinely cares about students' understanding of the material.  allows resubmission of papers for additional points."],"courses":["ENGL121","ENGL331","ENGL121","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL124","ENGL436","ENGL121","ENGL068","ENGL121","ENGL068","ENGL21","ENGL21","ENG049C"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":990,"section":2,"class_nbr":9171,"title":"DIRECTED READINGS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"STERN,KIMBERLY JO","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":3,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2136642","fname":"Kimberly","lname":"Stern","quality":"5.0","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["One of the best professors I have had.

Prepare for close readings and a lot of tough/conflicting ideology. He is very helpful in his office hours and makes an effort to know everyone in his class. He really believes in his students and their abilities and he's so encouraging!","Dr. Barbour is my favorite professor at UNC. He is obviously a genius and knows all the texts backwards and forwards. He will make you work for it, and the papers are really long, but they are worth it. His lectures are passionate and intense.","Possibly the hardest class I took my first semester, but worth it. He's an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable. Very passionate on the subject and obviously an expert in his field. However, he is also a tough grader and there is a lot of reading and analysis. And usually the prompts won't be things that we studied. Overall a good class.","Professor Barbour was a great professor who consistently and enthusiastically helped students. He was very passionate about his subject; he worked hard to make the subject material somewhat interesting and while it was a bit of work to do well, it was definitely worth it.","Rapid lecturer, but don't be intimidated! Happy to help with papers, and a very nice guy. That said, start papers early and edit carefully. Three shorter papers and one long research paper, but the midterm isn't bad at all. A brilliant prof who is clearly an expert in his field. Lecture-based, not as much discussion. Take it!","This is my favorite professor ever.  Not only in the English department but the whole school.  He teaches at a fast pace with the ultimate enthusiasm.  I have taken him three times since being a student at UNC.  Take his class, you will not regret it and you will learn so much.","He is an awesome professor. I was intimidated by him at first because he paces and yells throughout lecture, but he keeps things interesting. I learned a lot in this class. Recitations are pointless, but the TAs are nice and helpful.","Probably the most I've EVER learned in a class. Barbour is incredibly knowledgeable and his lectures are always fascinating. A great help on writing papers, in everything from choosing a topic to proofreading. He's funny, but also intellectually demanding, serious, and thought-provoking. Highest recommendations (plus he brings his dog in sometimes)","The man basically paces in front of the class for an hour every day and yells at you.  Not a bad sort of yelling.  Just an animated exclamation of everything you could possibly want to know about Milton.  Be prepared for a fast pace.  He's amazing.  And very helpful when it comes to paper-writing.","WOAH this guy knows absolutely everything about the 17th century. Take good notes! His exams just ask you to spit back what he said in class. Super helpful with papers. I've never had a more enthusiastic teacher. Loved his class."],"courses":["ENGL120","ENGL228","ENGL120","ENGL228","ENGL120","ENGLENGL","ENGL120","ENGL120","ENGL230","ENGL160"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
