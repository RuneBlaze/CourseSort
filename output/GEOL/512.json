I took GEOL lab at the same time, learned the same concepts from class, and got an A- but yet I would fail all his exams. His tests are crazy specific. If you're taking this class, be ready to work for an A. He does curve at the end though","This class was way harder than expected, and Dr. Benninger is a really nice guy once you get to know him but it was difficult to stay focused in class because the lectures are pretty mundane. He does curve tests pretty substantially which is nice!","Lectures are boring but he talks at a pace that's perfect for note-taking. All the exams were multiple choice but extremely difficult. Definitely not \"rocks for jocks.\" Thought it would be an easy A but was sadly mistaken. Wait until you can take GEOL101 with Kevin Stewart, if you have the chance. Seriously.","Not a bad teacher but he's pretty boring. Tough to stay focused during lectures.","Prof. Benninger is a sweet, older man who loves the subject of geology. His lectures are fairly boring, but he makes several humorous remarks that are hysterical if you are paying attention and catch them! To me, his exams were incredibly difficult though, but I am not good at multiple choice tests. No hw though & the textbook is not really needed.","class was boring, but he says some really funny things when he's lecturing. You are only graded on multiple choice exams, which are curved. The lowest test is dropped. no homework","The class was dull... but you can only expect so much of a class that is focused on rocks...The exams were multiple choice..no h/w or quizzes..exams came from the notes and were easy to ace...THIS IS THE SCIENCE FOR BUSINESS MAJORS!!"],"courses":["GEOL101","GEOL101","GEOL101","GEOL101","GEOL101","GEOL11","GEOL11"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
