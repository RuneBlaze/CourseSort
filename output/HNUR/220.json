DEFINITELY TAKE HIM.","Great professor! He's clear, extremely nice, passionate, and willing to help. I can't say too many good things about him and his class!","Awesome teacher! Very lenient with grading and with deadlines. He's very flexible when it comes to scheduling exams/quizzes and tries his best to accomodate others. The class is also fairly entertaining. Skits are pretty fun-not harshly graded. The door into hindi website gives you pretty much everything you need to study for exams.","The most amazing professor at UNC. So understanding and indulgent and does not go hard on his students. 1 quiz and 1 dictation every week which are fairly easy. Take him!","","Great teacher! While his Hindi skill are extremely impressive, especially considering that he is not a native speaker, his teaching skills are even better."],"courses":["HNUR102","HNUR101","HNUR101","HNUR101","HNUR101","HNUR101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
