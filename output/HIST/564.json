She always encourages group discussion without making it awkward and seemed passionate about American history and her students.  She was great for the small seminar setting.","Professor DuVal was extremely enthusiastic about the material and made the lectures easy to follow. I actually looked forward to going to class every day, but that may just be me. As long as you keep up with the material and participate in the discussion in recitation every week, you should be fine. One of the best professors I've had at UNC.","I thought Professor DuVal was a good teacher until I got my final grade back. I was surprised to see that it was a B+ instead of an A-. 10% of my attendance grade had been deducted because I was in the hospital during one of my recitations. She sided with my TA when I asked for the points back on my attendance grade, saying that I shouldn't get the","Honestly, if you've taken us history before and do the reading for recitation, you don't need to go to class. All the work is based on the readings and some key terms that she posts online.","Her lectures are crystal clear and could not possibly be more straight forward. If you pay attention and care anything at all about history you should like this class. Professor DuVal is cheerful and loves her subject.","My experience with her might be slightly different than normal since she taught this class for the first time this year. There are a few kinks to work out with her method to teaching a film class but I think she is a great teacher. Her lectures are clear and insightful and she tells you everything that will be on the test beforehand. Study the IDs!","She is a great teacher with a good personality. There is reading every week and sometimes a paragraph, but the work is definetly managable. Recitation is interesting an enjoyable as well. The exams are fair, and follow the material taught in class, and with some studying the class is easy.","No Comments","boring lectures, pretty straight forward about tests though. you need to go to class though, my mistake.","Prof DuVal's lectures were interesting, it was a good class, not many assignments, very straight forward and clear. Had to do write a small paragraph on weekly readings, one quiz, a paper, a midterm, and a final.
