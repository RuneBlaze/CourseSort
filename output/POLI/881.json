Though test prep may take some time, there are no curve balls on his tests.  Attendance and participation aren't required, but by going and paying attention you'll have all that you need for the lecture part of the tests.  Very nice and funny guy!","Professor McGuire has become one of my favorite professors at UNC. If you're interested in anything related to the Supreme Court or the Constitution, he's the best pick. I've also taken his Supreme Court class and it was excellent! Professor McGuire is a fantastic lecturer and always encourages student dialogue.","Professor McGuire has been one of my favorite professors at UNC. The course was 4 non cumulative tests and a 10 page paper. He is clear about expectations and he is an engaging lecturer. If you are pre-law I would highly suggest taking him as this class is mostly constitutional case study.","McGuire is my favorite POLI teacher because he speaks clearly and concisely. He also has an awkwardly funny sense of humor, which makes the class less boring. Three exams and a non-cumulative final. Three in-class essays in response to an article that was given ahead of time. It is clear what he expects of you, which makes it easier to get an A.","A nice guy, who knows a lot about the subject.  But, McGuire is quite possibly the worst test-writer I have ever encountered in my life.  He teaches on very objective material, which is redundantly echoed by the book and then makes his multiple choice tests a tricky subjective guessing game.  I don't recommend this class.","all in all this class was ok. his lectures, although helpful, were pretty repetitive and boring. the class isnt hard per-se but definitely not the best class ever.","Dr. McGuire rocks! He always keeps class interesting. Assignments always have a true purpose. He's extremely friendly and helpful if you ever need to see him outside of class. If you want an A, you HAVE to do the reading.  Multiple choice questions on exams can be tricky so read them very carefully. Overall, great professor and class.","Class was very interesting and Prof McGuire is a great lecturer. His tests are challenging but doable if you've read thoroughly and paid attention in class. Approachable prof who is very willing to help students outside of class.","I took him fall semester in Supreme Court and in Constitutional Freedoms.  The classes were for the most part interesting.  He knows his stuff, and is a good teacher.  His multiple choice tests were pretty easy, especially if you take notes and read.  For constitutional freedoms he was informative.  Test were easy but a lot of information.","Took Him for Supreme Court and US Constitution. Great professor. This is not an &quot;easy a&quot; class- but if you're at all interested in law school its a must. I'm in Con Law right now and am more than prepared due to his class. He's a cool guy who knows his stuff. His multiple choice exam was harder than essay in upper level. You do need to go to class.","McGuire is a great professor and his lectures are very helpful for really grasping the material. I have taken 2 of his classes and would take more if I weren't graduating.","Attendance isn't mandatory because power points are online, but class is so interesting- I went anyway.  The 3 mult choice tests aren't bad if you pay attention/study a lot/and DO THE READING.  Also, don't over analyze the tests questions. Very helpful in office hrs as well...a plus if you make an effort to meet him personally.","Great teacher. i took the class in the summer and the test was 10 short id's. they were straight forward my class avg atleast a B- if not a B. I would highly recommend it.","I really enjoy his lectures.  His 'Civil Liberties' class is even better if you want to actually find out about the Supreme Court cases themselves (this is just the history and functioning of the court) and are looking for a more discussion-based experience.  You MUST go to class and take detailed notes, but otherwise the class is easy.","No Comments","It was easy if you went to class and were able to think analytically about what he says. His tests are hard for some because they often require you to go beyond memorizing and actually learn the material. Almost no reading though and having no papers is a plus.","Lecture was interesting but tests were impossible...DON'T believe him when he says &quot;I don't put trick questions on my exams&quot; on the first day of class!","Easy class if you go to class and do the reading, 3 multiple choice exams. Good lecturer but not much variety in the class."],"courses":["POLI410","POLI411","POLI410","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI73","POLI73","POLI79","POLI79"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
