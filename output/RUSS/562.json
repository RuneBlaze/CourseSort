She has trouble clarifying (and basically teaching) concepts. Readings are fundamental-- only way to survive","Professor Pertsova is knowledgable about the information she is teaching but does not necessarily communicate the information effectively. She has lecture slides for the class and seems to fly through the hard material and spend an excessive amount of time on the easy information. Her main goal for the exams is not to test your knowledge of the mat","She's obviously very intelligent, but probably BECAUSE of that doesn't seem to understand why students don't understand things as soon as she explains them. She's terrible at explaining concepts and tends to be pretty disorganized. The material can be interesting and you can probably manage a decent grade, but don't expect her to be much help.","She is a very smart individual, but some people are not born to be teachers.","really easy A and sort of interesting. don't go to lecture, it's not helpful. just read the book and read the lecture powerpoint notes on sakai and you're set. she also gives lots of easy extra credit opportunities, so it's probably in your best interest to do them. i had kline as a TA and he was really good as well","Well, the class is utterly pointless first of all. You might actually do better if you skip  the class in the giant lecture halls, She posts the exact lecture notes on Sakai. Do your best if you take this class; it's hardly ever in your field of study and is a &quot;filler class&quot; that nobody wants.","She is very very nice. The class itself is pretty hard and challenging, but if you go to class and put some time in the readings you'll do fine. She re-explains the readings in class and takes any questions you might have. I really liked her, she's also very enthusiastic"],"courses":["LING409","LING101","LING301","LING301","LING101","LING101","LING409"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
