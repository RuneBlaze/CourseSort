She is so sweet and really cares about the work she assigns. I only took her class for the three gen-eds, but it was still interesting. You have one midterm and a final test, but you have three 5-6 page papers, but she grades easily. She also takes attendance and grades on participation."],"courses":["GERM210"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
