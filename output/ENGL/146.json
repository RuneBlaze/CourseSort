She talks a lot in class but picks interesting books. Essays aren't too difficult and she provides feedback and the chance for a rewrite. Office hours were very helpful. Would take her again without a doubt.","I love Dr. Current. She's professional and really knows her stuff. I've taken multiple  classes with her. She really cares about you if you respect her and put in some effort. Don't take a class with her if you won't be able to dedicate a decent amount of time to it.","Dr. Current's class was almost unnecessarily difficult. She seemed like a nice person but she was very narrow-minded with how she wanted things to be written. When reading through comments on my papers, it felt as if she was marking them simply to have marked them. She rambles in lectures and is very hard on attendance. I don't recommend her class.","I really enjoyed this class. You have to schedule office hour time. The first two units require a lot of work, but are informative for those interested in health science. The last science fiction unit, however, was completely irrelevant. This class requires a lot of writing, but if you have a good foundation it'll be an easy A.","Loved this class. I was almost always behind in the reading so I didn't participate in discussion as much as I would have liked but Professor Current is one of the coolest professors I've ever had. Tons of respect for her.","Easy and fun. There is reading, but the books are actually interesting/entertaining. Try not to get too behind on reading, because it can be difficult to catch up. You can miss 3 classes, before it hurts you. Current is awesome! She encourages open discussion about many of the tough issues brought up in the books you'll read. Loved it!","Prof. Current is a great teacher and very accessible and helpful. She doesn't ask for much in terms of homework and you can pretty much BS your way around this class and get an A, if you really want to. She's a great teacher, very much interested in what she teachers and instills that interest in her students. She tries to help as much as possible.","Most helpful teacher I ever had. She was extremely helpful during office hours and shows real care for her students. But she is a tough grader and strictly adheres to attendance.","Very helpful and open to different viewpoints (she's liberal, I'm conservative, we're friends). Really wants to get to know her students. Gives fair grades and expects people to improve and participate. Lectures can ramble a bit, but it's not too bad. Lots of emphasis on the actual writing. Expectations are clear.","Current is really passionate about her teaching. She taught a variety of works in the class, from short stories to novels to movies. Class discussion was encouraged and was easy to follow. Assignments were hard and Current was very helpful with essays. She even had an option extra credit assignments for kids who wanted to improve in their writing."],"courses":["ENGL123","ENGLISH146","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGLISH146","ENGL146","ENGL146","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGLISH146"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":146,"section":1,"class_nbr":8099,"title":"SCIFI/FANTASY/UTOPIA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0222","days":"MWF","time":"11","instructor":"ROSS,DAVID A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":35,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":1,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=552183","fname":"David","lname":"Ross","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"Gives good feedback (4)","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SO MANY PAPERS","EXTRA CREDIT","TOUGH GRADER","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["He is incredibly pretentious and do not think of sharing an opinion that does not align with his own. 3 papers , all 5 to 7 pages each, and 2 feeder assignments. He gives plentiful feedback on each paper, follow the advice and its not difficult to make an A. Agree with what he says and nod your head to lectures. Much harder than other sections.","David Ross is a spectacular orator. He is very knowledgable in subject matter and beyond. Helpful if you ask for it. Class not too bad, although it's quite a bit of reading. Show up to class for key points, take two easy multiple choice tests, and write two papers (with generous amount of time to do them) and that's about it.","He was the most annoying teacher. He talks everyday with a powerpoint, and talks about one slide for 15 mins. He asks questions in class and then when you answer he says \"mm hmm\" and then disagrees with you. He's so picky about giving As and if he gives an A it's an A-. There are group projects too. DON'T TAKE ENGL 105 WITH HIM, you will hate it.","Dr. Ross is a great lecturer and ENGL143 was very interesting. I would recommend this class to anyone that needs the VP credit. You watch 2 movies a week and discuss them in class. 2 papers and a midterm, basically minimal work. He is also a fair grader!","Dr. Ross is incredibly intelligent and interesting, but his lectures can get a little dry. He assigns three big papers, along with a few feeder assignments. In my class, we wrote a research paper, a restaurant review, and a film analysis. He provides helpful detailed feedback, and I feel that I have genuinely improved as a writer.","The class doesn't have too much work, but David Ross isn't very helpful at all. The class is very boring, he hates giving As (likes A-s and B+s the most) and he's extremely pretentious. He doesn't like it if you don't write in his style or if you suggest an interpretation of something for a project that he doesn't agree with. Find someone better.","David Ross is not what everyone says he is.  He knows that he is smarter than you and you constantly feel that idea swirling around your head during each lecture.  He is not helpful and very slack with grading.  I really wish I would have taken anyone else.  Please do not be fooled by these reviews, he is not a good teacher for ENGL 105.","Dr. Ross is a smart guy and I actually feel like I've become a better writer after taking his class. There are only 3 papers, and you submit multiple drafts, allowing you to receive ample feedback. He's kinda dorky and really into foodmovies, but he is a kind person and does not grade very harshly.","I learnt a lot from his class. He wrote very helpful comments and suggestions about my papers. This course was not hard: just three papers (each paper has three drafts)and two presentations.","Just absolutely spectacular. I think he's probably one of the few people in the world who can transition between quoting Lolita and discussing it without sounding artless, boring, and stupid in comparison with Nabokov's beautiful prose. He's a brilliant man and a great talker without being incomprehensible or condescending. Hope to have him again!","Good class :) He is ridiculously intelligent... could be the smartest person I've ever met. Uses lots of big words but not incomprehensible by any means. I enjoyed this class; great course structure and good book and movie choices for the most part :)","BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN. It's not suggested for the anti-intellectuals, but for anyone interested in quality film, it's a must. Ross is extremely passionate about film and is one of the most scholarly yet easy-going people I know. If you're reading the other comments, don't heed them unless you exclusively watch mindless blockbusters.","I took this film class because I thought it would be fun...BIG mistake! Most of the movies are incredibly long and hard to follow. It didn't turn out quite as hard as I thought, but the lectures are extremely boring, be prepared to zone out for the entire class.","He is really passionate about the literature, but his voice is rather monotonous. He doesn't really encourage class discussion, but his lectures are pretty good - if you can stay awake for them. Grading is not too harsh, but he expects a lot.","David Ross is a very smart guy. But his interest was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey(old edition). It was horrible. However I ended up getting a B out of the class with numerous visits at the writing center and his office. Make sure u get plenty of sleep before coming to his class because he can be boring!","Don't take this class unless you REALLY love sci-fi.  The work load is really heavy...about ten books and four movies to watch outside of class.  The exams don't really count, just the papers, so as long as you're a good writer, you'll probably do okay.  But David wasn't helpful at all, so be prepared.","Professor Ross is excellent. He is absolutely brilliant, offers excellent insights on the works we read, and I sincerely recommend anyone take him. One of the smartest professors I've ever had, and overall a very fair grader.","spare yourself the pain of taking his class.  He is VERY BORING and it is annoying to listen to his monotone voice.  You watch several sci-fi films and write 3 papers and a few feeders.  The work isnt hard, but the time spent in class goes by painfully slow.  he put me to sleep in every class.  try another english teacher, there has to be better","Dr. Ross is a wonderful professor. His insights into Romanticism are fascinating and I thoroughly enjoyed going to his class. If you are a dorky English major like me, you will really enjoy this class and Dr. Ross as a person. Very nice man, very helpful. Two 8-12 page papers, and a final exam with 50 multiple choice and two short take home essays.","B-O-R-I-N-G. Although Eng12 isn't supposed to be fun. The class was easy, he was just a very boring teacher. He doesn't really answer questions so much as talk about himself. He likes to slip in comments about The New Yorker at least once a week, which is extremely annoying."],"courses":["ENGL105","ENGL146","ENGL105","ENGL143","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL132","ENGL124","ENGL143","ENGL143","ENGL121","ENGL101","ENGL146","ENG146","ENGL101","ENGL437","ENG12"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
