She was fair IMO. Also gave lots of extra credit where i had like 115% in a quiz category, and she drops lowest test. Experiments are easy A's. All this helps toward an A","This class is absolutely terrible. Her powerpoints had little to no words and were the exact same as the reading guide. Instead of providing us with answers she made us \"turn to a partner and discuss\" for the entire class period which is extremely awkward and unhelpful considering most people are not well versed in neuroscience. Awful Class.","Dr. Penner's class was pretty awful. She's trying to do a flipped classroom, but it doesn't work. She ends up just reading the textbook to you most classes. The material is interesting and so are most of the guest lectures, but her lectures are totally pointless. There's also a ton of work, which can get frustrating. Not going to take her again.","She's really cool, and reached out to me when I was struggling. But there are tons of readings, quizzes and experimental designs due really frequently","Dr. Penner is extremely passionate and excited about neuroscience. She is a very fair grader. You'll definitely have to do the readings and keep up with assignments, but if you do that and pay attention in class, you'll be fine. She seems unapproachable at first, but I promise if you speak to her outside of class, she's super nice and helpful!","A lot of the lecture is just reiterating and making clear what you read in the book.  With that being said, readings are pretty much the bulk of the test material.  She seems to be a bit unapproachable if you question her.  Tests are specific.  She encourages participation in class.","I really like Penner. I'm even signed up to take 2 more classes with her before I graduate next semester. Yes, her tests are hard, but if you do the reading and the quizzes, paying attention in class isn't totally mandatory. I tended to do the opposite: pay attention and not read too often.","First opinion, \"nice enough\". But as the semester went on, it was clear that she's a pretty tough grader but tests come straight out of lecture and book so if you pay attention, you'll be ok. She is very unapproachable and also very defensive if you try to question her outside of class about her grading, get's very upset if you don't participate.","The tests were very detailed, but her lessons were clear and connected to the book material plus she's very nice and fair!","She does not teach well. She does not go over the test material and her tests are very detailed even though they are on minimum 5 chapters. It does not get easier after the first test!","Don't go to class. She reads the power points to you. . . Enough said.","Although she is nice, she is not a good lecturer. I think she realized how boring she was about halfway through the semester when she started to include anecdotes and attempt to be funny when she speaks. After a certain point I stopped paying attention and just did work for other classes. There is a ton of material and her tests are very specific."],"courses":["PSYC315","PSYC315","PSYC315","PSYCH315","PYSC315","PSYC315","220","PSYC437","PSYC390","PSYC390","PSYC390","PSYC390"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","AVERAGE"]}}]
