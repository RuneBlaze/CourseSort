She doesn't like it when you have a different opinion then herself but if you write what she wants to hear in essays then you'll do fine. And speak up- she's not the harshest about participation but it does matter","Took CMPL 240 (Film Analysis) with Pollmann and I won't take another film class. She's extremely smart, but the lectures are long and the class is very analytical (but you must share her views).  She's not very clear in her expectations and assigned a 10-12 page paper with numerous prompts. Required to watch a film every week and only enjoyed 4.","Her lectures provide a lot of insight into the films we watched. She is pretty low-key, though had us do some dense readings. She asked us to answer questions on them, but mostly to guide our reading. Seems like a tough grader, but is easier and more understanding than. Is willing to focus discussions on what the class is interested in","I took this class for Germ 303, which is normally just a German Lit class, but she has actually re-structured it so that you spend half of the semester focusing on literature and the other half on German film. There's no textbook, but you do have reading and written assignments due every class. I enjoyed it and my German improved substantially"],"courses":["GSLL69","CMPL240","CMPL240","303"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
