Class participation is graded and you have to show up to get a good grade. Homework is mandatory, but only graded for participation and she lets you turn things in late.","Farida is an amazing Arabic teacher! I love her so much, she makes learning fun and is always ready to help you if you have trouble.","Super sweet lady, always willing to help but sometimes doesn't fully understand what you are trying to ask/say. She is a great professor and I really enjoyed arabic 101 with her.","She is one of the best professors I've ever seen.","Sweetest lady you will ever meet. Very enjoyable class, however DEFINITELY was not well prepared for arabic 203"],"courses":["101","ARAB102","ARAB101","ARAB102","ARAB101"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
