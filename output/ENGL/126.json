We never knew what was going on because she was never clear. She never recalled what she said and constantly contradicted herself . Most frustrating class I've ever taken. Take someone else for ENGL105. You can only get an A if you're willing to try to do exactly what she wants (which you will never know).","I love this class, Dr. Frost leads amazing discussions and causes the class to feel more like a family. You won't want to miss this class because everyday is pretty much unplanned. You probably won't like this class if you're very shy but she breaks you out of your shell easily!","Coming from someone who has never enjoyed English, I really enjoyed this class b/c of Leslie. She is an extraordinary lecturer and engages the class in really interesting, deep discussions about the books read. Discussion is an integral part of the class, though you don't necessarily have to contribute. Leslie is easily 1 of my favorites professors","Dr. Frost is very intelligent, and she strives to have students emerge themselves in the issues they write about. If you put in effort for the class, a good grade can be achieved. I definitely recommend!","Dr. Frost is the best professor I have ever had!  Her class is so much fun, and I learned a lot.  I strongly recommend taking her classes!","Leslie Frost is my favorite professor at UNC. I loved her class she was extremely helpful. Almost all the readings were available online. Take a class with Leslie Frost.","Dr. Frost is a great teacher, especially for english 105. She divided are small class into groups and every group in our class got along so well. The class dynamic was great, she often didn't hold class, and was very understanding about assignments. The class only had 3 projects and each was set up very well. Highly recommend her!","I would really recommend Dr. Frost.  She was an excellent English teacher who taught with clarity and provided interesting and accommodating projects that helped me acclimate to college-level work and research. She is experienced and willing to go out of her way to help you.  Also very interesting.  Ask her about living in Turkey.","This class is honestly a lot more work than what I expected for an English 101 class and her late/attendance policy is a bit over the top. In the end, she is a great professor that makes an effort to get to know you and is always available in office hours. The class is intellectually engaging and class time is enjoyable. But, again, a lot of work.","She is really earthy and fun! But she gets frustrated when everyone doesn't participate in group discussion. So if you're not a big talker...don't take her. She has her favorites. Her class really doesn't make sense, but it isn't hard to do well in it. Tons of readings...i never read and I did quite alright!","Dr. Frost is extremely helpful. I have never enjoyed an English class so much.","There's quite a lot of readings, A LOT of class discussion, which i hate. but if you like it, you'll love her class probably","I hate english, but loved this class. It was very interesting, & all assignments were based on the West Memphis 3 murder trials. There are 3 big assignments and 4-6 small ones, but none are too hard. She holds office hours a lot and is willing to help you with papers. If you don't usually enjoy english classes, I strongly recommend taking from her.","Excellent Professor! Take if you can. She makes class interesting. There is a fair amount of work - 3 units with one or two feeders each. Nothing outrageous. Class structure is great - our class had the consistent theme of the West Memphis 3 for all assignment. Again, take her class if possible!","Interesting class, yet requires attendance and alot of work, but it is worth it in the end. Class participation is strongly encouraged and is a large part of the final grade. She is helpful but difficult to get in touch with.","Not that difficult. She's a little eccentric, and always reminded me of Miss Frizzle. I would recommend the class to anyone who has to fulfill this requirement.","Great professor. I decided to take her for English 102 as well. This class isn't just a walk in the park, as attendance and actual work is required, but, in return you get an enthusiastic professor who's not afraid to let students out early, bring breakfast to class. or get off topic. Actually learned a lot from this class. Worth taking.","No Comments"],"courses":["ENGL105","126","ENGL128","ENG105","ENGL126","ENGL122","ENGL105","ENGL102","ENGL101","ENGL128","ENGL101","ENGL128","ENGL102","ENGL102","ENG102","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENG122"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
