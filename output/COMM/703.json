He's approachable  is happy to clarify or review a point in class if needed. Attendance is not mandatory, but it definitely helps. You read about a chapter out of the book each week in addition to a research article. His exams are writing intensive but pretty straight forward.","Dr. Mumby wrote the textbook, but I never felt like I was hearing it verbatim during lecture. His lectures are interesting, he's hilarious, and he wears fun colored pants. 55 would take again."],"courses":["COMM325","COMM325"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
