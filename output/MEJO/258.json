He's a state politics guru and you'll have a big advantage if you like politics and public policy. Might take some time to get used to his sarcasm and his jokes. But he's a good prof to know in the J school; I'd take at least one class with him.","Story due every week. Requires a lot of work and you will do well,  likely earning a \"B\" if you adhere to expectations. O'Connor himself said that earning an \"A\" requires you to devote you life to this class.","Expects students to devote huge amounts of time to the class, assumes each student wants to become a reporter. Lectures more than any journalism professor should. Actually helpful if you see him outside of class, but his grading is very vague and leaves you guessing. Very full of himself, likes to tell his own stories, which are often irrelevant."],"courses":["258","JOMC252","JOMC253"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
