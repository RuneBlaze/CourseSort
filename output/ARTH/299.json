We had discussions about all the readings but you don't necessarily have to read to participate.  I found the material very interesting so I did read.  She is extremely qualified and a great lecturer.","A truly excellent teacher, her enthusiasm for the subject matter is infectious and she is very capable of leading a productive class lecture and discussion.","I absolutely love Rovine. She is extremely sweet and helps you grasp her love for Africa. Do not skip class and participate or you will lose points from overall grade. There is a midterm and final; and a research paper. A very relaxed class , yet so informative!"],"courses":["ARTH89","ARTH488","ARTH297"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
