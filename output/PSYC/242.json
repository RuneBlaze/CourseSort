I didn't study much and got a 99% as my final grade, just keep up with the online homework, the final isn't even cumulative.  The class was an easy A but it was so interesting, and Professor Griffin is entertaining and engaging.  Highly recommend any class with her!","Her class is very engaging and interesting and she is wonderful lecturer. The homework is very reasonable and it gives a helpful outline to be prepared for class and to help with exams.  The exam questions are kind of tricky you just need to read them carefully and really pay attention in class. Overall great class.","Overall great class.","Dr. Griffin was an amazing intro to Psychology. She was very clear in lectures, used PollEv to keep us engaged, and made it very easy to get a good grade. The reading was very reasonable, and she gave guided reading questions for every class. If you do the homework, pay attention during review, and participate, you will get an A.","She gives very interesting lectures and the materials are easy to understand. There is homework before every lecture, but less than my other classes.  HW typically takes 45 minutes to do, and prepares you for lecture and exams. I think exams are a bit tricky, you really have to understand the material not just recite it. She's a wonderful lecturer!","There is textbook reading almost every night, but if you like psychology then it will be fine. She talks very very fast so you have to listen carefully or you will miss information. She is a bubbly person and enjoys her job you can tell.  the exams are not too difficult, but you do need to study a lot because there are some tricky questions!","You know those test questions you read, and your first reaction is:  \"This is just meant to trick me.\" She likes to give a lot of those. My final grade suffered because of that reason, in large part. Ridiculous.","I feel mentally exhausted after sitting through her lectures because she talks sosososo fast. But that's just me.","She is a very clear and engaging professor. Assigns Poll Everywhere questions during class as a way to check attendance. She gives extra credit before exams and the final is not cumulative.","Great teacher, interesting to listen to.","Dr. Griffin is literally the BEST psych teacher I've EVER had. Attendance isn't mandatory, but she gives random quizzes for attendance. She makes the class easy to follow and hard to fail. If you like bubbly teachers... She's perfect."],"courses":["PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC110","PSYCH101","PSYC242","245","PSYC245","PSYC245","PSYC245"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
