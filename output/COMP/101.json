Takes off a ridiculous amount of points for minor things. Also, BEWARE of the final exam! It is a group project, which can be really frustrating!","She is a complete mess. This class was so frustrating. She did not have a syllabus or a calendar except for the one she updated daily. She expected students to do well and complete labs without the knowledge or tools necessary. Grading is super unclear and she grades kind of on a whim. Be prepared if you take this class to be frustrated.","The class overall is super easy, but Pozefsky makes it awful. She's extremely scatterbrained and changes her mind about the way she wants things a lot. She doesn't give you time to finish in class assignments and then deducts points for turning in late. Not much respect for students. She made me so aggravated one day I left and never went back.","Sooo boring. We spent most of the semester listening to each other give presentations on games and businesses. Expectations and grading standards are very unclear. If you don't have any programming experience, you're going to be in trouble for the final project (which is most of your  grade).","Very ambiguous with her requirements, has added many more assignments in comparison with her prior classes. You have to do an assignment every class period due by the next day. She got over a month behind in grading. Basically big assignments will suffer due to the inability to get feedback on the labs (daily) that are combined in main assignments","She is very helpful during office hours and will explain exactly how she wants the assignments done. You can ask questions during quizzes that will give you all of the answers. Overall good class.","Classes are boring as hell, but basically shows you exactly how to do your homework and quizzes. Homework grades weigh 70% of final grade, take them seriously! Sometimes you will lose points for stupid stuff, she is a perfectionist.","Pretty easy class, just go to her office hours and she'll tell you exactly what you need to do to get a good grade.","Nice, very helpful teacher. Constantly has technical problems during in-class tutorials, though. Class is based solely on projects and communication of grades is very poor, but overall the class is not difficult.","Extremely helpful...you can ask her to look at your project before you turn it in and she will tell you everything that you need...it was her first time teaching a 101 COMP class; nonetheless, she was not very clear at all with instructions for projects","The bangs are where it's at.
