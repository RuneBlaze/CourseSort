Politics is my thing, philosophy isn't, but professor Spinner is an amazing lecturer and overall instructor. Very passionate about what he teaches and makes you think and question everything. He's tough though, so get ready to read and study. The class is doable, but you have to be willing to work hard.","Dr. Spinner is honestly one of the best teachers I have had. Although the reading was dense and difficult to understand, the class discussion made it so that we knew what the important parts were. He assigns papers more than tests, take into account improvement, and gives honest, constructive criticism. You should be willing to put in the effort.","Professor Spinner is amazing. I loved this course! But it is not for the lazy student. You have to read, and you have to come to class. But do it! A really good class.","I feel like I learned a great deal in this class, but the TA grading is very inconsistent and the smallest of errors may eliminate any chance you had of getting an A. Tons of reading, though I sort of liked it because I had always wanted to read the great political philosophers but lacked the motivation. Take only if very interested in the subject.","Unclear lectures and unclear readings are individually not enough to ruin a class but this is one situation where the two meet. Expect excessive amounts of what feels like unnecessary reading because even when you do it it's entirely possible to misconstrue it and get screwed on an essay or exam. Take if you need to but don't expect a fun time.","Difficult course, huge amounts of reading; most of which is dry and, at times, beyond comprehension. Still, Prof Spinner will offer you extra help if you ask him for it. He does come off as intimidating, but in the end, he bent over backwards to help me through the course material. NOT for slackers.","Definitely a difficult class.  Don't take this just to knock off a gen. ed requirement.  That's what I did, but luckily I realized I really enjoyed the material.  I learned a lot.  Take this if you genuinely have an interest in the subject.  Professor Spinner-Halev's lectures get redundant but he knows what he's talking about.  Overall a good guy.","This class was extremely, extremely difficult. I mistakenly took this class my first semester of my freshman year...DO NOT repeat this egregious mistake. I struggled initially, but I actually performed well overall. My TA saved my grade...I went to her during office hours for help nearly every day. Work in groups for these exams.","This class was insanely difficult. The teacher talks incredibly fast so be ready to type. Attendance is not mandatory but you better go or have notes from someone in the class. The reading is difficult with about different authors who all have similar concepts you must be able to recall. The TA's grade all tests and papers-they are extremely picky!","Spark Notes will not save you when it comes to this class. You better be prepared to do some serious reading (in old-school language!) Also, the grading on papers and exams was ridiculous.","Although lecture attendance is not required, if you plan on doing well in the class, lecture is extremely helpful.  Professor Spinner-Halev does a nice job of explaining the confusing theoretical concepts, especially when it comes to digesting the dense amount of reading material assigned.  The TA's grade the work and can be nit-picky graders.","The class itself was definitely difficult, but I thought that he was very good at explaining complicated concepts. You definitely need to go to lecture to understand the readings and know what the main points are. I thought that exams and papers were tough but were graded fairly.","Don't take this class if you don't like to do readings or speak in class discussions because that's all this class is. Dr. Spinner-Halev is extremely knowledgeable and leads the discussions well but the class content comes from the class. He does seem to acknowledge that the subject matter is quite complicated and is a very fair grader.","Tons of reading.He keeps the lectures about as interesting as you can make modern philosophy.All the grading is done by TAs though;I got a bad one and ended up with horrible grades while my friends turned in comparable work to other TAs and got 95s and higher.Went to him for help once and he was very helpful, although he comes off as intimidating.","The tests and papers aren't so much difficult, but they are graded extremely toughly.  A 90 is as high as it gets on any assignment (no matter how good it is), but the TAs do all the grading. The prof was very helpful when I went to see him though.  You must go to class to understand what's going on.","Not helpful; rather cold. Lectures are long and intense--though you should definitely attend to understand the philosophers.

The hardest part about it was sitting through the 2 and a half hour discussions on the movies we watched the previous class. Very easy to get a good grade, there are 3 papers due throughout the semester comprising 40% of grade and the final is open everything and she gives you the questions ahead of time.","Conover was a great lecturer. She's knowledgeable, funny, and very explicit about what she expects from you. Her lectures were straightforward, interesting and she sent out study guides in advance so that you could prepare for the tests way ahead of time without any curveballs. I would definitely take another class with her!","I took this class so that I could learn about US government. I actually ended up learning about current social issues. This class doesn't have that much outside work and not really any homework because you don't actually have to read all of the NYT's articles she assigns. I would take this class with a different prof. She curved my test grade down.","This class was more difficult than I expected, and if I had looked on this site, I would not have taken it. The grading scale is tough, the lectures are boring. The class is centered around the New York Times and you actually have to pay for a weekly subscription. The recitations are good, and getting a good TA is important for passing.","She isn't a terrible teacher but she's not great either. Definitely one of those middle aged people that thinks our generation and technology are ruining the world. Her lectures, while not particularly engaging or interesting, are clear. Lectures are optional but  go and take notes on what she says, not just her powerpoints. Required NYT reading.","She is very politically inclined and that is made clear in her teaching. I had a hard time expressing my own opinions in the small group setting.","This class was by no means easy, but her lectures were very engaging, and if you do your work, you can surely get an A. Getting a good TA really matters and participating in recitation discussions helps your grade (and it wouldn't hurt to take notes during them). I had Mr Petrash and he was great. But go to lectures and take good notes for sure!","Not very understanding at all.","Watching movies is great and this class is not hard at all, but once Conover starts to lecture, I lose all interest. She teaches like a high school teacher, has the least helpful power points imaginable, and will shut down anyone's ideas that do not align with hers. It's not a hard class at all, but I just can't handle her as a professor.","I think if I were to have read some of the most recent ratings before I took this class, I wouldn't have taken it and would have missed out on a great class. Granted, this class is far from an easy A, but Conover knows what she is talking about and if you put in the work you will reap the benefits.","Go ahead and switch your professor now. Interesting course, but she is really tough. Lectures are somewhat interesting, but the amount of work you put in outside the classroom is ridiculous. Instead of being graded on your New York TImes comprehension level, read it for fun and switch to an easier professor.","Hated this class.  Lectures are actually fairly interesting but are biased and have nothing to do with the rest of the class. The exams and papers are completely based off of the NY Times, which makes it more difficult.  Would NOT recommend this professor.","Connover's class on the surface is very simple. I went into the first exam with a high level of confidence and left with the same amount. I thought I aced the test no questions about it. I was shocked when I received a 68. TA do everything and are the most strict graders I have EVER experienced. Run for the hills if you receive Martin Caver. Horrid","She gives good lectures, but that's about the extent of what's good about taking her class. The class in general is very hard and time consuming. Work for her class includes reading the NYT (which all papers and tests are based on), 2 exams, 2 papers, 4 quizzes, and  online discussions. Don't take this class if you already have a tough schedule.","Interesting lectures, clear and organized. I don't understand why EVERYTHING has to be taken from NYT for papers and exams. Worst part of this course is you have to pass 3/4 book quizzes (which are pretty difficult) to even get at least a B+","Unless you want to pay for a New York Times article and learn somely about ONLY the NYT, DON'T TAKE THE CLASS. Conover knows her stuff and the lectures are fairly interesting, but outside lecture the only thing you do is talk about the NYT. All exams and papers are based only on the NYT. I honestly left the class knowing the same as when i started.","Conover does know her stuff, but she is biased. I came into the class wanting to major in poli sci, but changed my mind after the class. There are only 4 graded assignments, and when I took it, the TA graded unfairly. I think she's a great teacher, but the class is too hard to do well.","Before finalS I was in the hospital. I made plans to retake it. Conover emailed me saying come either tuesday or thursday during office to retake it. I was back home and out of state so I emailed her back thursday and she didn't reply. When I arrived she cussed me out saying I was stupid to come when she didn't respond. HORRIBLE PERSON AND TEACHER!","Pamela Conover is a horrid professor. She knows her stuff, but she's so biased that I found it hard to take anything she said seriously. I learned a lot about how George Bush is the devil, and how the evil white man is continuing to keep everyone else down. I was going to major in poli before I took this course. Conover changed my mind.","Professor Conover knows her stuff. Keeps class engaging. Never thought I would like poli sci but she changed my mind.

He is extremely boring, lectures are extremely long , they tend to last 45mins at the very least. The exams are difficult... Would not recommend.","Lectures are long and boring. He is a dull lecturer and seems to repeat things a lot.  I ended up not going because he put the lecture notes online. The TAs were annoyingly critical and made his tests for my class. You always left the tests feeling good until you got your grade back.","Lectures can be dull and boring. There are only two tests and they are multiple choice. The class isn't hard if you show up to class and do the readings. The information is fairly straight forward. He's good at answering questions.

I would definitely take more classes with him","Stimson is very smart, easily accessible, refreshingly relaxed, and extraordinarily reasonable when it comes to scheduling & grading. The lectures are interesting, informative, and well organized. He posts all lecture notes online (even discourages in-class note taking). Course grade= average of 2 papers (5pgs each), not difficult w/ notes+texts.","Stimson very helpful, as are the notes he posts online after the lectures. The tests are easy if you read the online notes and pay attention during lecture. The recitations are almost a serperate class; they are very difficult and involve lots of reading and writing.","Stimson is a captivating lecturer with a passion for his field of study.

The blackboard site is very helpful.  Tests are multiple choice and not hard, but they're very short, so not much room to screw up.  The final's not cumulative.  Unfortunately, recitation is like a completely different class with a lot of boring reading and a few papers.","Stimson is a respected political scientist who adds goofy humor to his lecture.  Take his class for an easy, yet worthwhile course.","The notes are online.  Attending lecture is useless.  TAs tended to be pompous and overbearing.  Study the notes and skim the required books and you can pull a solid B.","I stopped going to his class b/c it was better to sleep that extra hour in my bed than in Hamilton 100 and he put the notes on blackboard.

I would really suggest just reading the lecture notes before the exam and try hard in the recitations.

It's not an easy course for anyone just to slack and get a good grade, but if you work for it, it's surely worth it. Professor is super helpful, friendly, and inspiring. Class discussion is always in a great atmosphere. professor smiles when you talk to her, and she gets so excited when someone come up with good thoughts!","Professor Bickford is a great professor. The first year seminar I took with her is one of my favorite courses I have ever taken at UNC. If you're taking it because you expect an easy A, you probably won't get it. But the class discussions are incredibly interesting, and you will improve your writing and analytical thinking skills.","Great prof!  Really let's everybody tell what they think about the questions at hand.  Also, she's very serious about participation so don't think that you can join her class and not talk or do the readings, which can get dull at times.  However, the great discussions make it all worth it.","I had her for Feminism in Political Theory, great teacher, SO passionate about this topic, but you definitely have to do the readings, which are usually quite long and sometimes really difficult"],"courses":["POLI270","POLI89","POLI270","POLI265"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":994,"section":60,"class_nbr":1960,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"MCGUIRE,KEVIN T","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=781403","fname":"Kevin","lname":"McGuire","quality":"4.2","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Skip class?

Though test prep may take some time, there are no curve balls on his tests.  Attendance and participation aren't required, but by going and paying attention you'll have all that you need for the lecture part of the tests.  Very nice and funny guy!","Professor McGuire has become one of my favorite professors at UNC. If you're interested in anything related to the Supreme Court or the Constitution, he's the best pick. I've also taken his Supreme Court class and it was excellent! Professor McGuire is a fantastic lecturer and always encourages student dialogue.","Professor McGuire has been one of my favorite professors at UNC. The course was 4 non cumulative tests and a 10 page paper. He is clear about expectations and he is an engaging lecturer. If you are pre-law I would highly suggest taking him as this class is mostly constitutional case study.","McGuire is my favorite POLI teacher because he speaks clearly and concisely. He also has an awkwardly funny sense of humor, which makes the class less boring. Three exams and a non-cumulative final. Three in-class essays in response to an article that was given ahead of time. It is clear what he expects of you, which makes it easier to get an A.","A nice guy, who knows a lot about the subject.  But, McGuire is quite possibly the worst test-writer I have ever encountered in my life.  He teaches on very objective material, which is redundantly echoed by the book and then makes his multiple choice tests a tricky subjective guessing game.  I don't recommend this class.","all in all this class was ok. his lectures, although helpful, were pretty repetitive and boring. the class isnt hard per-se but definitely not the best class ever.","Dr. McGuire rocks! He always keeps class interesting. Assignments always have a true purpose. He's extremely friendly and helpful if you ever need to see him outside of class. If you want an A, you HAVE to do the reading.  Multiple choice questions on exams can be tricky so read them very carefully. Overall, great professor and class.","Class was very interesting and Prof McGuire is a great lecturer. His tests are challenging but doable if you've read thoroughly and paid attention in class. Approachable prof who is very willing to help students outside of class.","I took him fall semester in Supreme Court and in Constitutional Freedoms.  The classes were for the most part interesting.  He knows his stuff, and is a good teacher.  His multiple choice tests were pretty easy, especially if you take notes and read.  For constitutional freedoms he was informative.  Test were easy but a lot of information.","Took Him for Supreme Court and US Constitution. Great professor. This is not an &quot;easy a&quot; class- but if you're at all interested in law school its a must. I'm in Con Law right now and am more than prepared due to his class. He's a cool guy who knows his stuff. His multiple choice exam was harder than essay in upper level. You do need to go to class.","McGuire is a great professor and his lectures are very helpful for really grasping the material. I have taken 2 of his classes and would take more if I weren't graduating.","Attendance isn't mandatory because power points are online, but class is so interesting- I went anyway.  The 3 mult choice tests aren't bad if you pay attention/study a lot/and DO THE READING.  Also, don't over analyze the tests questions. Very helpful in office hrs as well...a plus if you make an effort to meet him personally.","Great teacher. i took the class in the summer and the test was 10 short id's. they were straight forward my class avg atleast a B- if not a B. I would highly recommend it.","I really enjoy his lectures.  His 'Civil Liberties' class is even better if you want to actually find out about the Supreme Court cases themselves (this is just the history and functioning of the court) and are looking for a more discussion-based experience.  You MUST go to class and take detailed notes, but otherwise the class is easy.","No Comments","It was easy if you went to class and were able to think analytically about what he says. His tests are hard for some because they often require you to go beyond memorizing and actually learn the material. Almost no reading though and having no papers is a plus.","Lecture was interesting but tests were impossible...DON'T believe him when he says &quot;I don't put trick questions on my exams&quot; on the first day of class!","Easy class if you go to class and do the reading, 3 multiple choice exams. Good lecturer but not much variety in the class."],"courses":["POLI410","POLI411","POLI410","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI202","POLI73","POLI73","POLI79","POLI79"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":994,"section":67,"class_nbr":1962,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"CARSEY,THOMAS MICHAEL","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":6,"enrl_tot":3,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":994,"section":73,"class_nbr":8389,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"ROBERTS,JASON MATTHEW","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":2,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":994,"section":66,"class_nbr":1961,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"MACKUEN,MICHAEL B","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1648992","fname":"Michael","lname":"MacKuen","quality":"3.2","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["Dr. MacKuen is obviously very knowledgeable and well informed on the subject.
