This is basically a high school psychology class. I slept some lectures.   I didn't go sometimes.  I never read.  I made an A easily. He is a funny guy and is pretty cool.","Read the chapters in the textbook and you'll be fine.","Great Professor! Very clear in lectures and open to questions. Really good at explaining concepts and uses a lot of real world examples so the lecture doesn't get boring. I got a C+ on the first two exams, but I actually studied for the final and got a 93%. It is easy to get an A in the class if you read the text and study for the exams.","Professor Wiss is great! He often shows video clips or movies during lecture, and will sometimes assign a pop \"reaction paper.\" Attendance is important, as he occasionally gives pop-assignments and the exam material comes straight from his lectures. The textbook is helpful, but it mostly just supplements the lectures."],"courses":["PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":500,"section":2,"class_nbr":8792,"title":"DEVEL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0307","days":"TuTh","time":"11","instructor":"Ulku-Steiner,Beril S","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":35,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":5,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=553414","fname":"Beril","lname":"Ulku-Steiner","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"GROUP PROJECTS (2)","grade":"3.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["INSPIRATIONAL","TOUGH GRADER","GROUP PROJECTS","HILARIOUS"],"comments":["She's awesome. Total sav","She loves her material, but tests are super hard. You can know the book and notes backwards and forwards and still have a hard time. Also, participation in class is mandatory, but class itself is basically just powerpoints. The group project is graded unfairly- she doesn't even watch you present, she bases it off what your classmates saw/thought.","Ulku-Steiner is awesome & has the best taste in style. She's super peppy and adorable and is so passionate about child development. But beware because the tests are SO HARD. The tests, along with the group projects killed my grade. But the research paper helped me out.","best prof i've had so far. helps students relate with funny anecdotes. assigned a project that was fun and helped make the material more comprehensible. cares about students doing well and understanding. i looked forward to going to this class every week, which was surprising as it was at 8 am. definitely sign up for any of her classes.","She was bright and sun-shiney at 8am...Attendance is pretty important. I do believe I learned most of the material from the book-READ IT!! Her tests come straight out of it, and her tests are tricky. Ultimately though, whatever she did worked! In the end i think she gives benefit of the doubt. She has students teach most of class w/presentations.","This Professor is obsoluterly awful. She does not know what she is talking about, she is biased and simply annnoying. Her test are IMPOSSIBLE","She doesn't teach to tests at all, going to class is worthless but she requires it. If you like teaching yourself, then take this course.","Her excitement in class is just a facade because she is not a nice person outside of class.  Purposely likes to make things more difficult and not at all understanding.  Told one girl that &quot;It's not the end of the world&quot; when she couldn't graduate 'cause U-S wouldn't give her a C in the class","Her tests are hard, which knocked me off at first, but she hung in there with me and helped me improve. You definitely gotta go to class - she counts attendance and tests on discussions. But she is a dynamic, smart, funny, and fun prof. No doubt. I took psych because I needed to fill a requirement, but she made me care about the material.","by far the BEST professor i've had at UNC so far.  makes class really interesting and is always excited about what she's teaching.  take this class if you have a chance but make sure you study because the class isn't a breeze.","Awesome professor -- inspiring, enthusiastic, extremely intelligent, and respectful.","Best class I've taken in Psych. She is smart, funny, and really cares about the topic and how it will affect our lives. Also spent lots of time counseling me about grad school choices.","I loved Dr. Ulku-Steiner! She was sooo enthusiastic, it was inspiring. Her class was challenging but not intimidating.","I've had her for two classes and would take ANYTHING she teaches. The most enthusiastic and caring professor I've had at Carolina. Varies presentations every day, brings in all kinds of speakers and extra materials, takes the time to get to know students out of class. Excellent prof.","Very demanding and you ABSOLUTELY must attend.","Material is very interesting and she is an awesome professor.  tests are hard and you really have to study, but its worth it. NOT an easy A, but if you are really interested there is no one better for this class","Not clear at all with instructions!

He definitely enjoys the material as well as wants to helps his students succeed. One of the best professors I've had at UNC.","Great professor! Highly recommended for any psyc majors. Especially individuals considering graduate school","HE IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!","This class was horribly boring.  He tries to make it amusing but I constantly had to fight off sleep.  Nice guy though.  Approachable and always looking to help.  But if you prefer a structured environment, look elsewhere.","Dr. Youngstrom was a great professor. I'm innately horrible at math, and with his help (his TA Andrew Freedman is really good too) I got an A in statistics! Always willing to help, and he obviously designs the class so you can get the highest grade possible. If you have to take PSYC 210, definitely take it with Youngstrom!","I took this class in summer session. It went fast. The professor tried to make stats interesting, did the best he could with the material. The TA does all the grading and was extremely strict. I disagree with the other student, when the TA made an error grading, he fixed it. The TA was extremely fair.","This dude is goofy as hell.  He does his best to makes statistics interesting.  Take his class if you get the chance.  You'll actually learn the material without being bored to tears.","He did a great job of making this a good class.  The class itself is incredibly easy/boring, but he did an awesome job of giving engaging lectures.  He's a really nice guy.  I would definitely recommend him as a professor.","Best Prof Ever! Makes Stats fun and very good at explaining. Recitations are not mandatory, but can be helpful. I totally recommend this class if you have to take psyc 210.","Wonderful guy!!! He made stats painless, which was great since none of us wanted to be there. He also gave us a spreadsheet before the final that told us exactly what each of us needed on the final to get the next highest grade and the next highest etc up to an A, but I think there was a curve at the end too, which explains my solid A.","Dr. Youngstrom is one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He managed to make something as boring as statistics extremely fun! I would recommend this class to anyone who is a psychology major or who needs a statistics class!"],"courses":["PSYC500","500","C829","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
