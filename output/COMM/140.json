I thoroughly enjoyed the topics discussed in lecture and truly learned a great deal from him. Though the TAs were difficult graders at times, conversing with them or Professor Thomas will help! Effort is required for the course, but it is a must to take with him! Pay attention in class!","Thomas crafts very confusing yet amazing lectures that made me feel like a fool; however he does not expect papers or questions to be of the same academic level. I had an introductory course with him, and although i didn't understand most of his sentence, I could grasp the concepts. I never did the online readings and still got an A.","Talked super fast and barely explained the terms he used and he used a lot. Only 5 grades total. 3 papers and 2 tests. He doesn't grade them and the TAs grade super hard. No curve. No extra credit. He posts powerpoints online but they're only pictures so they didn't help. First test is take home but SO HARD! 2-3 30 page readings a week.
