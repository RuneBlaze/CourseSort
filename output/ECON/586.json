You will get an A if you work.","I really hated this class with a passion.","Professor Turchi is a great person but a horrible teacher. He can't break concepts down to answer your questions. Do not take his class. If you do, buy an AP Stat book and prepare to teach yourself. Nonetheless, it is easier to get a better grade in the honors section because you get more attention but are put on the curve with the large lecture.","Turchi's tests were ridiculous. The lectures were very clear and he answers questions well, so you feel like you understand the material in class. Then you get to the test and it seems like completely different material. He doesn't seem to care much about whether students pass or fail.","Turchi's okay, his lectures are tough to stay awake through as he is not the most interesting person to hear speak but they are pretty informational. Our tests were free response and he gave a lot of partial credit. Only homework was studying for the exams and short presentation you would give during recitation every 2 weeks. Class not that bad.","Avoid taking his class. He wants to clarify every point but his lecture is too lengthy and complicated. Learn from textbook will be more helpful. His grading is too strange and tests are tough.","Turchi is a nice guy and he loves economics, but sometimes he can overcomplicate things and make them confusing. Reading the book is not necessary, but it helped myself further understand the material. Regardless, ECON 101 is just a hard class regardless.","His lectures are incoherent. He gets off on wild tangents and I, as someone who doesn't immediately understand math and statistical analysis right away, am left completely clueless. And then there's his beautiful line, \"If you want, you can come up here and I'll explain it better with calculus.\" something that would help me like a punch to the face","Terrible class. Avoid Turchi as a professor at all costs.","there are three components of the class - mystatlab, stata, and lectures. and none of the components work together to facilitate learning. the exams are lengthy, complexified expansions of turchi's confusing and unorganized lectures.","His lectures are not useful; he just rambles on about data that you don't need to know. You'll have to teach yourself through the textbook. There is a lot of homework (stata and statlab take hours to do).","His lectures for econ 400 are completely unhelpful. I ended up just teaching myself from the textbooks.","Turchi is a nice man and he tries to be helpful, but in doing so he often over-complicates things that should be simple. His exams are very difficult (he aims for class average to be around a 70), but his homework is relatively easy.","One of the most ambiguous professors I've ever had. Often crams many different ideas onto one single graph, and boy does he love graphs. Graphs take up more space in your notes than words. The practices tests aren't anything like the actual tests although he claims they will be. If you don't read the text you will be lost. Exams are short but hard.","Rough teacher, very dry and slow. Doesn't inspire nor motivate. He's knowledgeable, might make for a good faculty, but an awful teacher. Ended up just skipping his class (econ 101) and read straight from the textbook. Take Balaban or Conway if you can.","He likes to ramble on and on in lecture with useless information that you'll probably never see on the test. You have to read your textbook and attend every recitation in order to make a decent grade. Gives out handouts and there are ALWAYS test questions with that info. Hardest tests ever. You definitely have to work for a good grade","I made an A, but that was rare. Tests are unbearable and lectures do not help at all. Your only chance is to go over practice Exams and pray","I'm not normally one to be tough on my college professors, but Turchi is the worst I've had in my 3 years as a college student. He spews out arcane economic vocabulary as he draws random, illegible graphs that confuse the whole class. Class average on the test is consistently below a 70, showing how little the class actually learns from him","Maybe Turchi is tough for Econ 101--I don't know--but he is easy for Econ 400. I literally have 100 in the class without putting that much time in. The Stata assignments and homework can take a long time, but beside that, the class is great.","This is a hard teacher, but he's probably one of the smartest professors I've ever had (if you care about that - take him). He doesn't use PPT or anything just writes stuff down and talks.  Bit hard to stay awake and focused - even though I'm an Econ major and am passionate about the subject. He definitely prepares you for upper level Econ classes."],"courses":["ECON400H","ECON101","ECON400H","ECON101","ECON101H","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON400","ECON400","ECON400","ECON400","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","101","ECON400H","ECON101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
