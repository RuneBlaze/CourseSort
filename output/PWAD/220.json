She is one of the funniest teachers I have ever had. She facilitated great group discussions, always encouraging students to \"say more.\" We generally had readings for each class, but you could just skim or skip them and still participate in class discussion. She really wants to get to know you as a student.","Two tests (1 midterm+1 final). READ everything. No textbook needed, all readings posted online. DO THE READING GUIDES, you won't get away with not doing them! She's intimidating at first, because she's absolutely beautiful and dressed well and she has a PhD from Duke. Seating chart is involved, BUT it's great, bc you get to know people! Recommended","At first Prof Smith was very intimidating, but you come to realize she really just wants you to do well and expects a lot. The midterm and final are totally fair and she prepares you for them. She voices her views a lot, and encourages participation but is one to pick favorites. Still, I enjoyed her course and would take class with her again.","Very good professor. Clearly very knowledgeable on the subject and has very interactive lectures. She's very enthusiastic about the topic.  Generally around 40 pages of reading for each class but you can get away with not reading it most times. Very easy grader and tests are not difficult. I would definitely take another class with her.","I didn't really like this class at first but it grew on me.  Prof Smith is very helpful when you go to office hours and wants to see students succeed.  She will give good grades if earned it but has very high expectations.  She is very reasonable and will always take the students' voices into account.  She can be pretty vocal about her views though"],"courses":["AAAD050","PLCY220","PLCY220","PLCY220","PLCY220"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
