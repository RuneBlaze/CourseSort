His classes are enjoyable, his style highly engaging and his marking very fair. 477 is undoubtedly a challenging course which requires a lot, but if you put in the work you will find a professor always more than willing to support you.","Professor Raleigh is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished, experienced and interesting professors at UNC. If you have any interest in Russian history or history in general, this is a fantastic class. It isn't easy - theres lots of reading and you have to show up. But you know exactly whats expected of you and the grading is extremely fair.","What an absolutely incredible human being Professor Raleigh is. He tells the most engaging, insightful, and awesome stories I have ever heard. I have taken many, many history classes at UNC and, after his, there is no doubt in my mind that he is the BEST history professor at UNC. In fact, he is the best professor I have had at UNC. TAKE HIS CLASS","I went into the class just taking it for fun. I was called crazy by some, but I thoroughly enjoyed the class. This man KNOWS his stuff. I paid attention every class, took good notes, and I received the grade I deserved. If it weren't for one slip up, it would've been higher. He wants you to succeed and he respects you as a student. Top class prof!","Introduced me to a subject I knew very little about in an interesting way.  Don't take this course if you don't care about Russian History.  If you want to learn more-you'll enjoy Dr. Raleigh's classes","Raleigh is an expert in his field.  Unfortunately, his field is Russia, a country that is cold, boring, and uninteresting.  However, I did attain my personal best Tetris score while in attendance of his class. Advice: If you must take this class, take it with a friend who can counsel you when you inevitably contemplate your suicide (Thanks David!).","Professor Raleigh attempts to make Russia interesting; however, this is simply impossible. You will find yourself asking why you ever thought Russia's history could be interesting. Save your own life and sanity. One redeemable facet; the cute TA with a wicked foxyhot mustache (but I think he's studying in Russia now)Advice: Don't take this class!!!","When he says do the reading before class- DO IT!! or else you will fail","really knows his****. seems intimidating and cold but is really a great help if you ask nicely. but don't try to slack off or bs your essays because he will call you out on it, possibly in front of the class.","Fantastic professor.  He is an expert in his field, makes lectures engaging, and is just a very personable guy.  You definitely need to put some work into the essay tests but it's completely doable.  Take any class of his if you have any interest in history.","his classes are difficult, and he moves very fast, but he really knows his stuff.  do the reading in advance; then you wont be helplessly lost during lecture. tests are hard, but do-able.","reading and lectures are very important. he talks really fast though and will not slow down. however when it comes to papers, the grading is harsh. he and the TA's will tell you how to do it and then your grade will be low when u take their advice. sectionals are really easy...tests are NOT!","Do the reading, take notes, come to class and you'll do fine. Tests a little tough. I would recommended starting a head of time. On the essays, brainstorm first, outline second.","He is the cat's pajamas.","Very friendly professor, tough but fair.  His criticism is *always* constructive.  I never felt belittled in his classes as I did with other professors at UNC to be left unnamed.  He makes history come alive.  His area of expertise is in modern Russian history, a topic everyone should know a little about.  Take his classes if you can!","Really amazing professor.  Extremely well informed and passionate about his subject.  His classes are difficult, but with effort they are certainly do-able."],"courses":["HIST477","HIS162","478","HIST162","HIST90","HIST162","HIST162","HIST162","HIST054","HIST162","HIST162","HIST162","HIST162","HIS31","HIST31186A","HIST031"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
