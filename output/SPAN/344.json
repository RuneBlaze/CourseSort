He was so knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and that motivated me to become more involved as well. He's hilarious and super helpful! I hope to take more classes with him because of how patient, encouraging and approachable he is. Definitely take him if you can!","One of my favorite coursesprofessors to date! So nice and relatable and just an all around nice guy ! Extremely helpful and easy to understand! I would recommend him to anyone!","I was worried about this class initially but he made it so much easier than what I had heard from other people with other professors. Strongly recommend!","He is the best professor I have EVER had. He is GREAT at keeping you interested in the material, always very helpful, extremely passionate, you will fall in love with him! :)","He is an amazing teacher!!! I am horrible at spanish and am doing really well in his class.. take during summer session and pay attention to all the details on the coutries. Fantastico!","No Comments","Very passionate professor, made me much more interested in the material. I felt that the class tries to cover too much, but that isn't entirely his fault. He is very helpful and explains things clearly, always open to help at office hours. Great guy!","His enthusiasm was contagious--a real passion for Latin American literature; however, I didn't take the class very seriously because it's so much easier than some of the other Spanish literature professors. If you're a Spanish major and take this class and don't make an &quot;A&quot; you need to find a new major."],"courses":["ROML58","SPAN344","SPAN203","SPAN378","SPAN204","SPAN456","SPAN373","SPAN373"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
