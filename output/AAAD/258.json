However, participation does matter as long as you answer a question with relevant info when he calls on you, you'll do fine. I honestly didn't try that hard in the course and still got an A-.","He was my least favorite teacher in my first semester at Carolina. He was quite boring and it was difficult to stay awake during his lectures  (granted it was an 8 am class), and we had extensive readings and weekly homework assignments. In class, he wasn't helpful but he still cares about his students and tries to help during office hours.","I tried to BS this class bc it seems easy but if you want an A you need to actually do the readings just where the homework assignments are concerned. He's a fair grader but it's a boring class and I'm sure there are a lot easier AAAD profs. in the dept. Take one of them!","This dude. I took this class expecting it to be like my other AAAD courses, keep in mind this is intro level. We had extensive readings with assignments due each week typed and turned in. We would discuss readings in class but he never answered questions, and if you raised your hand to answer, he would shoot you down and go pick a random person...","First off this guy is funny. He had a way of dropping a joke just at the right time to lighten the conversation. Beyond that, he knowledge of the information being taught was amazing. He is strict on the attendance policy, and turning in weekly assignments. If you turn in the weekly assignments, and pay attention in class you should do fine.","I liked this class and I liked Prof. Janken a lot. He was definitely difficult, he hated people that didn't pay attention or read the assignments. I found that if I kept up with the reading, the rest was easy. Also, I think it is important to note that the people that hated his class don't even have proper grammar. Um, does that tell us something&#63;","I LOVE AFRICAN AMERICAN SUBJECTS AND LOVED THE TOPICS DISCUSSED BUT I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH HIS GRADING TACTICS. GRADES ARE GIVEN WHEN IT'S TOO LATE TO DROP FOR A REFUND. 50% MID-TERM/50% FINAL. STIGLER ABOUT PROMOTING THE WRITING CENTER; UNCLEAR ON WRITING ASSIGNMENTS WHICH WEIGHS HEAVILY ON THE GRADE! NO BENDING, NO EXTRA ASSIGNMENTS; WISHY WASHE","Great teacher, really interesting. He's not easy, and expects you to read what he assigns, but the tests are exactly from his lectures and the reading. Get involved in the discussions and talk to him after class. He does NOT like smart-asses.","THIS CLASS SUCKED. HE STUTTERS ALOT. AND CONTRADICTS HIMSELF WHEN HE TEACHES.  I HAD A 4.0 AFAM GPA BEFORE THIS CLASS & HE GAVE ME A B-!! AFTER I SPOKE TO HIM HE 'REMEMBERED' THAT I'D DONE EXTRA CREDIT & CHANGED MY GRADE TO A 'B'.  THE CLASS WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME.  I DIDNT LEARN ANYTHING & IT WASNT EVEN A REQUIRED COURSE.  DONT TAKE HIM -- EVER!!"],"courses":["AAAD130","AAAD130","AAAD130","AAAD130","AFAM102","AFAM140","AFAM267","AFAM101","AFAM41"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
