She makes class enjoyable - it flies by. She constantly has us participate and it really makes a difference in your ability to speak the language. Plus, she's a fun teacher who really connects with her students. She's sweet so just give it your best and you'll do just fine.","Amazing professor. Extremely engaging and helpful, best french professor i've had here. Tough grader because she's a native speaker, but nothing new with french professors at UNC. She definitely improved my french speaking and was extremely helpful and available to help outside of class. Take with Pruvost if you want to improve your french","Tough grader, yet again, I honestly didn't try much. Takes points off for things that are clearly typos. Nonetheless, great professor! I found her classes fun and my speaking and comprehension improved a lot. I do recommend if you want to accustom your hearing and comprehension to native French.","Dr. Pruvost is a native French speaker, so she knows what she is talking about. She is a hard grader (I've only gotten one 96 and then nothing higher than a 90). I think an A- is pretty doable. In my opinion she makes her classes fun and tries to encourage you to participate and get it wrong in class than on the exam. I reccomend her. :3","She is extremely fluent in English and obviously French (from Paris), but she is also very stuck up and thrives on correcting any mistake you make. Also her grading system makes no sense, because you get huge percentage points deducted for each little spelling mistake or grammar error. Typical Parisien snob and I don't think my French improved much","Really strict.","Dr. Pruvost is very enthusiastic and very nice. She does grade a little hard compared to other teachers (I normally get A-'s in other French courses but only got B+'s in hers), but I feel like my French improved. For 300 and 310, she does not assign very much outside work.","Dr. Pruvost's classes are highly entertaining but effective with reasonable amounts of homework. That being said, she an extremely demanding but excellent professor who will transform your French skills if you try in the class. If you're someone who likes to strive for perfection, then Dr. Pruvsot is one of the best professors at Carolina.","It all depends on what you want... Pruvost is an excellent teacher but a VERY tough grader.  My French skills got much better, but not a single person in our class got an A. If you're looking to improve a lot, I'd take it, but if you're worried about your GPA (I was), I reccommend one of the grad school teachers.","Very nice, and is very interactive in class but teaches as if everyone should have already mastered the skills that are being intorduced in this course.","Pruvost was the best French teacher I've ever had. With her, you get what you give. She is ALWAYS available for extra help. She is crystal clear in her explanations and is a master of French and English. She always responds to e-mails promptly and thoughtfully. Yes, she's though, but my French skills have sky-rocketed.  My whole class adored her.","The devil. She is rude and cold--typically French, just like the commenter below noted. Assigns ridiculous amounts of reading & work!; if you aren't better than her @ French (which you can't be) you'll get a C. She loves giving horrible grades & is a terrible teacher & person. She doesn't really even 'teach', just tries to make everyone feel dumb.","She's very knowledgeable and clearly wants students to know the material, but if the class average is a C does that say something about the students, or the professor&#63;","She's nice, but she's VERY difficult.","A  little too pretentious for my tastes. The typical French bee... if you ask me. Her classes are somewhat rewarding though. I learned something."],"courses":["FREN203","FREN203","203","FREN203","FREN260","FREN350","FREN310","FREN204","FREN105","FREN203","FREN204","FREN372","FREN203","FREN","FRENCH003"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
