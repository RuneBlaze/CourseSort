I definitely try to take courses with this professor, because he can be depended on to help you get a solid foundation in the major. This was one of my favorite courses in my undergraduate career.","Very fair prof. You have to do the work (sometimes there's a lot of it) and know the material, but his exams are very straight-forward and his expectations are generally very clear. He offers extra credit throughout the semester and he is enthusiastic about his subject."],"courses":["SPAN683","SPAN377"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
