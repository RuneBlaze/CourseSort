He is hilarious and really cares about his students. Just make sure to do your homework and participate in class! He makes it easy to participate, and is incredibly helpful, so don't be afraid if you say the wrong answer. He will give you the grade you deserve, but he is a wonderful teacher!","Professor Gomez planned each class well, and his powerpoints were both informational and HILARIOUS. His class was always entertaining, and he really cares about his students. If you want to learn a language at all, he will care about your learning and help you succeed. Definitely the most I've ever learned of a language in one semester.","LOVE HIM. very tough, but it's hard not to like him. Spanish 260 was my favorite class, because it was actually interactive. He got us to participate daily. If you do the readings and study all the time, it won't be too bad. Expect pop quizzes and he's also a harsh grader!","THE BEST PROFESSOR I have ever had. He is a kind and caring professor, a joy to talk to, makes hilariously entertaining and yet educational powerpoints. Do everything you can to take a class with him. He is fantastic.","El profesor Gómez is an understanding, passionate, and funny teacher. Speaking classes are always uncomfortable when you're learning, but he was incredibly helpful during office hours. Anyone who refers to his class as \"my dear students\" and means it clearly cares. Show him you do as well and you're golden.","Gomez is quite possibly the greatest professor you will ever have. He doesn't give out grades that you don't deserve but he cares so much about the material and his students and is hilarious. He's the sweetest man and calls his class \"my dear students\". If you work hard, participate and study you will do well. Go to his office hours!!","Professor Gómez is a fantastic teacher. He makes an effort to get to know all of his students and get them excited about learning Spanish. He's studied pretty much everything so if you have a question, he has the answer. Not the easiest professor, but certainly very rewarding.","A great guy, really interesting and really loves his students.  However, he does not make the class easy and 99% of the learning has to be done at home, out of the book, which sucks.  If you can easily learn Spanish on your own I would definitely recommend taking him over someone else but if you generally have a hard time I would reconsider SPAN204","Prof. Gomez clearly loves his job. He is very interesting and funny and makes classes easy to enjoy. He's a really wonderful professor.","Really nice guy!!! Go talk to him after class!!! He has some interesting stories to tell!!!! However,  he teaches way too much out of the book and I didn't learn much of anything in his class.  The book was really bad so the class was often boring.  Gomez is a great guy though.  Really cares about his students!","Best teacher ever, very funny and kind. The class is not hard at all and he grades easily on papers.","He is a great teacher who loves teaching Spanish.  He is probably the best professor I have had at UNC.  Definitely take his class if you have the chance - you will not regret it.  He keeps things funny during class and is very laid back during class.","He's a sweet man who cares about teaching a lot. He's very non-threatening which makes it easy to worry less about mistakes. I've had nothing but good professor in this department, but he was by far the best.","AMAZING! one of the best spanish  professors I've had so far - he's extremely enthusiastic and his little Powerpoints are wonderful - and sometimes humorous. fun class - just participate, don't worry about messing up. He's not intimidating at all and will help you with whatever you need.","He was an amazing professor! He was so interested in his subject and his powerpoints were a little slice of heaven! (If you have him you'll see what I mean)Maybe the best professor I've ever had in Spanish and maybe even school period.","Fantastic professor. I had a great experience and plan on taking more classes with him in the future.","Very energetic about teaching.  Really want students to succed and will work with them in this regard.","He wants to be a poet... and turns out he is one. Do not get wrapped up in the philosophical stuff. Ohh yea... pretend you really care about Spanish and he will seriously LOVE you. Love = A","No Comments","an awesome spanish teacher--willing to work with you and presents material in an understandable manner. classwork isn't necessarily easy, but its fun and he's a good teacher"],"courses":["PORT101","PORT101","SPAN260","SPAN255","SPAN255","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN4","SPANISH4","SPAN4"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
