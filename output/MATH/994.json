He is a wonderful person and cares so much about his students. He always goes above and beyond. Absolutely exceptional.","THE BEST professor I have ever had. Jason Metcalfe is both an amazing mathematician and an amazing professor. His class was not easy, but it was so rewarding. If Jason Metcalfe is teaching a course- take it. Regardless of what it is. I would take any course with him, even if I didn't need it for my major. He is awesome!!!","I can't recommend Jason highly enough. He by far the best math professor I've had at UNC. His class is hard but worth it especially if you are considering math grad school. His number one priority is making sure his students learn. He is always willing to give advice on math, grad school, or anything else you may need. Very accommodating.","Jason is the best professor I've ever had!!! MATH 521 is notoriously difficult, but prof Metcalfe makes the material attainable. He cares a lot about his students and will spend the entire lecture on one proof if you are confused. Not the easiest prof, but you will definitely learn the material well. I wish I could take him for all my math classes."],"courses":["MATH521","MATH521","MATH521","MATH521"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":994,"section":64,"class_nbr":5735,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"SAWON,JUSTIN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":10,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1787787","fname":"Justin","lname":"Sawon","quality":"3.8","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK (4)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["CARING","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","TOUGH GRADER","CARING"],"comments":["Honestly,  I love this man. He saved me in calculus. Whenever I needed help, he was there. His lectures are long and tend to put you to sleep, but if you can stay awake through them, you'll understand how thorough and well put together they are.","Sawon is brilliant and helpful, very clear but class moves quickly so pay attention. also, do the effing homework - annoying but worth it! class is longest ever but passable without always attending lecture. overall good professor - and an aussie! ;D","Sawon was not a difficult teacher, easy B if you pay attention in class and easy A if you have taken calculus before. (You will still need to pay attention in class). Attendance is basically optional, so it is harder to pay attention in class than it sounds.","Sawon is clear throughout lectures and always asks if anyone has questions. He does a great job at explaining concepts and taking his time. Homework is online, which is really annoying, but it is doable. The tests get progressively harder but are also doable. Dont really need the textbook, just the webassign code.","Quiet, mild-mannered, math-magician. Intelligent, but a really nice guy if you get to know him well enough. Go to class, and try to stay awake. If you have trouble with web-assign, speak up in a recitation. Sawon loves to help, often with a quiet joke a soft smirk. A mystery, worth getting to know better.","You don't have to show up to class which is nice. 2 tests are fair, one sucks for the midterms. Trust me, you don't need to understand the Web Assigns. Just do them by whatever means necessary and don't take them lightly. This curve needs to be huge though, I'm anxiously waiting to see how nice it is.","Very clear in his examples, willing to answer questions, and discuss any problems during office hours. He assigns homework based on the material covered during class, and every now and then will throw a curveball. He uses webassign, which isn't the most user-friendly website, but the problems are relevant to the test. He has an Australian accent.","Sawon is very clear in his examples, and will answer any questions.  Also, he is very helpful in office hours.  He also has a British accent."],"courses":["MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","231","MATH233"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":994,"section":58,"class_nbr":8312,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"MITRAN,Sorin","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":10,"enrl_tot":2,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=823911","fname":"Sorin","lname":"Mitran","quality":"3.2","easiness":"4.5","help":"4.5","clarity":"4.5","topTag":"Tough Grader (4)","grade":"4.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["EXTRA CREDIT","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","SKIP CLASS?

He expects you to be more than proficient with understanding and be very active in reading ahead.  Be ready to program a lot. I worked extremely hard to finish the hw, but those are the majority of your grade.  He can be blunt and condescending and but not necessarily unwarranted.  Text is useful","Prof. Mitran is a very interesting professor, but his lectures are long and sometimes don't cover what you need to know on the homework assignments. Tests are difficult and he doesn't really review for them at all.","Lectures are long, but you have to pay attention or else you will fall behind. Each homework takes about 8 hours so start much earlier. He uses half-functioning virtual machine called Tarheel Linux that you might have to ask ITS to help you install. He uses Octave too. The tests are easy but you have to know the concepts and steps.","Soooo many homework ,  long lecture, better learn those material by yourself","Best professor I have ever had in the math department. He holds high expectations for his students, but his tests are very fair and he is also a fair grader.","Dr. Mitran is undoubtedly a very intelligent individual. However, he fails to clearly communicate many of the ideas he wishes to teach in class, and I learned more reading outside papers on the topics discussed than I did from his lectures or notes. He is also an incredible tough grader and can be very derisive towards questions he feels are inane.","The course is demanding, and he has no interest in holding your hand. He often belittled those who asked questions in class, creating an environment where everyone was afraid to speak up.  Not a nice guy.  That said, he lectures well.  I learned a lot in this class, but I wasn't a rewarding experience.","Mitran's MATH 566 was the most difficult mathematics class of my undergraduate career (BS Math).  Having survived the class though, I can honestly say I learned more from it than from any other.  Mitran is a strict and intimidating professor, but I feel this is a fair trade for the amount of knowledge he tends to impart.","Prof. Mitran will push you and make things difficult, but he's fair and you get a ton out of the class. Highly recommended!!!11!","Lectures were interesting and well motivated. By far the best lecturer I have had. The workload is hard but fair and helpful to learning the material.","Honestly this is by far the worst professor I have ever had","No Comments","No Comments"],"courses":["MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH661","MATH566","MATH566","MATH662","MATH662","MATH529","MATH529","MATH81"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
