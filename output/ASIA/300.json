She is likable but her TA was a bit of a know it all and Prof leave was often late to meetings or class. There was a lack of clarity with what she called reading memos, both with their due dates and content. Looking back, I would not take this class again","Professor Leve is extremely intelligent when it comes to Buddhism, she is more than willing to go in depth to help explain a concept that isn't quite clear. She provides study guides for her tests and they are fairly graded. Going to class is important because the information from her lectures will definitely be on the tests!","Professor Leve let us know the first day of class that she would not take it easy on us and she made good on her promise. That being said, she is a wonderful professor and person who is cheerful and has an open personality and an open office door to her students. I always enjoyed my talks with her. Lectures presented very straight forward.","Fantastic teacher.  She is really passionate about Buddhism, and eager to help you understand the material. Her tests are really long, and very fast-paced but what you gain from the readings and lecture are totally worth it.","Buddhism is complicated, but Prof. Leve tries really hard to make the material understandable. You will need to do the readings or you won't understand what's going on. Challenging class, but one I actually learned something in.","Class was pretty confusing.",""],"courses":["RELI283","RELI283","RELI285","RELI283","RELI283","RELI237","RELI285"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
