Crazy woman, good crazy though. Super disorganized, regularly threatened my committee in a project for not doing work, when we had to wait for other committees to do their work so we could implement it. Lots of scare tactics, sarcastic remarks. Be on her good side.","Dr. Willis is very unclear with her expectations. Classes are dumb, she just rambles about irrelevant stuff. I learned nothing in this class. Showing up to class and pretending to be interested is a must. She expects A LOT (30 hours) of time spent \"exploring\" outside of class. Would not recommend.","Any FYS with Rachel is a fab way to knock out some GE requirements and make some connections with university staff (she can open so many doors no matter what your major). She teaches through sporadic anecdotes that seem strange at first, but you end up learning a lot about life in general. Doesn't post grades, office hours are a must","She is lovely, and she is very funny. HOWEVER, she is EXTREMELY disorganized. She does not tell you what she expects, and she grades you down whenever you do not do what she wants (which you do not know what that is). LOVED the class, but do not expect a good grade unless you can read her.","Dr. Willis is a kind, passionate person and professor. But BEWARE, she is EXTREMELY DISORGANIZED. I immediately enjoyed lectures, but it lasted maybe three lectures. It was a somewhat rewarding class, but was highly frustrating due to her lack of non-preparation. LOVED the material, probably wouldn't take her again though","Rachel is a nice person and is very passionate about what she does. However, she is VERY DISORGANIZED. In the beginning, I really liked this class but that lasted all of three weeks. She expects A LOT of time outside of class from you and has a lot of impromptu deadlines. She will have you bending over backwards and then give you an average grade.","Very disorganized, didn't explain assignments well enough and was inconsiderate to students and their personal life. Was helpful when asked but did not provide any type of rubric for the course and lectures pertained only to her life and lessons she learned from it.","Rachel's enthusiasm is contagious and fun, but she wastes a lot of time talking about interesting but irrelevant things. This class is pretty disorganized, which caused me a lot of stress. Overall it was fun, I gained new skills, and I feel that both my determination and ability to travel the world have greatly increased.","Horrible experience overall. Takes sides of student arguments instead of mitigating conflict. Hostile attitude. Email threats outside of class unless we \"comply\" with her mandate. Didactic and dictatorial. Faild a student for 3 absences while not even showing up for first 2 classes herself!","Awful!!! I was pulled out of class on multiple occasions and threatened with a failing grade unless I show \"enthusiasm\" toward the material. When explained that I have epilepsy/adhd, she went on about how sick her dog has been lately and how much pain that is causing her. Bizarre experience. AVOID.","unfair, unorganized, teacher who never knows what she is doing with her class until the last minute. TONS of take home work because she never gets anything done in class. holds grudges aggainst students. she LOVES to talk about herself and how she is an amazing person and a great teacher. full of herself... very poor instructor.","rachel is the most condescending professor i've ever had, her lectures are boring, is very demanding about time outside of class time, and can't seem to get over herself. avoid!","Dynamic teacher.","rachel is awesome.  she is really inspiring and makes us want to get out there and really do something with our lives.  her lectures are unbelievably confusing, though, and most of the time i have no idea what's going on in the class.  it's worth it though because i feel like the work we're doing in there is really meaningful.","Lectures have no point, consistently lets class out late, makes demands on time outside of class, smells funny, is extremely condescending","Excellent teacher who keeps you involved. She is helpful and friendly, but make sure to keep up with work and must go to class."],"courses":["AMST61","AMST51","AMST51","AMST51","AMST498","AMST61","AMST61","AMST61","AMST275","AMS06","AMST057","AMST275","ECON398","AMST6E","AMST6E","AMST006E"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
