I want to be his friend.","Awesome teacher, great class!  Would recommend.","If you have to take PHIL 101, I would recommend Kotzen. There are only two papers and two exams and they were all equal weight of your grade. The tests were MC, and if you study they aren't bad. The papers weren't that bad, and if you go to your TA (they grade them) they are helpful. You don't have to go to class either; lecture slides online.","although he has an obvious passion and love for philosophy, and he was entertaining at times, i did not enjoy the class. a good class for someone interested in philosophy, but not a good class to fulfill your PH credit. There are two papers which arent hard but the midterm & final are tricky. If you go to class reading isnt needed.","I really enjoyed this class. It was probably the only class this semester that I actually enjoyed going to. There were a few boring days, but for the most part, the topics were pretty interesting, and Kotzen added in a lot of subtle humor. It's more about depth than breadth, but it's definitely a good basic starting point for philosophy.","Though not my favorite class, Prof Kotzen gives a good intro into Philosophy. There are only two papers, and you're allowed to rewrite the first one. Participation is taken into account at the recitation, but as long as you pay attention in class there's no need to read the text. The exams can be a little tricky, but if you study, you'll be fine.","He is easy to listen to and the essays are pretty easy. The exams cover a lot but the questions are pretty straight forward and you will do well if you study. Attendance isn't mandatory and the power points are online.","He's really nice, the class is relatively easy. That being said if you do not like repetitive people do not take his class. He says the same thing about 500 times and often continues talking a minute or two after the class is supposed to end."],"courses":["PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101","PHIL101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
