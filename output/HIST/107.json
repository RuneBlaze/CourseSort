Essays due way too often. Not to mention having an essay due on Friday and then a test the following Monday. Like I said, great lecturer, but way too much work for an intro level class.","Great professor, if you have the chance, take his class. Super helpful.","Absolute best professor. He's very concerned with his students understanding the material, he's a fascinating lecturer, and he's very clear about what he wants.","Prof. Whalen is one of the most interesting professors I have had at UNC. He is passionate about Medieval History and is fun to listen to. His lectures are always engaging, he is always cheerful and so excited about lecture you can't help but enjoy the class. The class is not the easiest but if you hit the books you should be fine.","Prof. Whalen is great, his class is always really interesting and fun to go to. If you have a chance to take his class, DO IT. As far as history classes go, this one is definitely one of the best Ive ever had.","Professor Whalen is an outstanding teacher, plain and simple. He has passion for the subject and presents information with perfect clarity. It's nearly impossible not to become enthralled and interested in his class.  Highly recommend.  I can't wait to take another of his classes!"],"courses":["HIST107","HIST177H","HIST107","HIST107","HISTORY107","107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST398","177H","HIST177H","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107","HIST107"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
