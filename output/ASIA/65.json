If you have some interest in Chinese history you would enjoy the class, however if you're unfamiliar with Chinese, the names in the readings may become a bit confusing.","I enjoyed this class a lot and Dr. Bergeton was very helpful whenever I went to office hours about a paper or exam. If you ask, he will help. Also, the lectures were interesting and the movies outside of class were interesting. Overall, I would highly recommend the class.","Do not take this class if you have little to no interest in Chinese history or little to no knowledge of Chinese names. You will be given loads of assigned readings every class. Professor Bergeton is very knowledgeable and will help if you ask but he's is not very clear on what he wants in terms of assignments and papers.","Bergeton gives decent lectures and cares about the topic but only marginally helps you when you visit him for office hours to discuss papers. He'll literally take out a big sharpie and write sloppily all over your rough draft. Most of the time it isn't even legible, just HUGE circles and underlining that obscures the text."],"courses":["CHIN346","CHIN 346","CHIN346","ASIA65"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
