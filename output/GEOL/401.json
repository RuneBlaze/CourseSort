He's got to be the most engaging lecturer and overall just a great professor. I appreciate his feedback and his clear dedication to geology. Writing this review a bit late, but he's just a great prof. Be prepared to work for that A though!","K Stew is the best! His tests are straight from his lectures so you definitely have to go, but he's so interesting that you won't even want to skip. He simplifies everything down so that everyone can understand everything. The only grades are tests, but they're all multiple choice. Best professor at Carolina and I'm not even a science major.","Quite possibly my all-time favorite professor. You can do the reading and kind of get an idea of the concept, but then you go to class and just start listening to K-Stew talk. Five minutes later, you realize you suddenly understand that concept from the book like it's the ABCs. That's how good he is.","K Stew was one of my favorite professors last semester! Super helpful and really clear with what he expects.  Reading isn't really required but you do need to show up to class everyday - his lectures are his tests.","Up until professor Stewart, I haven't had a single instructor that could allow for me to actually bare any sort of science course. Geology isn't just a subject to teach to Stewart, it's a passion and lifestyle that projects through his energy. There were too many times where I was so caught up in his lectures that I had forgotten to take notes!","This guy was seriously my favorite professor I had this semester. I do not like science by any means and wanted to take the easiest one possible. Highly recommend this class if you're a non science major trying to get the PX credit. I got a C in the class but that's a reflection of me as a student, because he really is a great teacher.","Such an amazing professor! His passion for what he's talking about is so evident, and he's one of the smartest people I know. No class with him is going to be easy, but he is extremely helpful and always there for you. His lectures are engaging and he's hilarious. Highly highly recommend taking a course with him, you won't regret it!","Dr. Stewart is, undoubtedly, one of the best professors at UNC. He's wonderfully passionate about Geology and really enjoys teaching. Definitely take the time to talk to him after class! His tests aren't easy, and his class will push you intellectually, but he's 100% there to support you along the way. (It's totally doable.) Take it!","I did not look forward to taking this class at all; I was just trying to get my sciences out of the way. However, he is the best professor I had during my first semester and he made the whole subject extremely interesting. You will be doing yourself a favor if you take this class.","I was one of those kids who REALLY dreaded having to take a science credit at UNC. Kevin Stewart was so good I ended up taking another class in Geology with him! Absolute must take if you need to take a science class.","Please take him. He is the best teacher I have ever had.","Kevin G! He is my favorite teacher so far at Carolina. I took his first-year seminar and now I'm enrolled in his GEOL 221 class for the Spring. He is really passionate about what he is teaching and he truely cares about his students and makes sure they get something out of the class. I'm actually thinking about majoring in geology because of him.","K-Stew is the bomb. Plus awesome fieldtrips.","Dr. Stewart is a great person all-around. Really cares about what he is teaching about, and gets the class excited about geology... all the test question come from lecture, so go to class. great class discussions, definitely gets you thinking about how powerful mother nature is...","Awesome professor! Favorite so far, this class was fun and I enjoyed going. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but it was definitely worth it as the only thing on tests was what he talked about in lecture so there was so need to read the book! Tests were multiple choice and pretty easy as long as I studied! He's also really funny! Take this class!","If you're looking for a science credit definitely take this class! Professor Stewart is extremely clear and makes geology interesting. I never read the book but felt prepared for every test. Everything is very straight-forward.","He was one of the nicest and smartest professors I have ever had at UNC.  Attendance isn't mandatory, but he has a 'chart' one where people sit just to know who's there or not...tests are MC and not that hard if you read over the book and go to lecture. He is crystal clear on everything. I recommend taking this class.","He's my favourite professor in UNC! The way he teaches, just makes you feel like you see the whole geological history unfolding through a mental movie reel. My favourite class! Class attendance is ABSOLUTELY important - as long as you pay attention, an A is in reach. And besides, why would anyone wanna miss a class that interesting&#63;&#63;&#63;","He's an awesome professor! Really clear, and as long as you attend all his classes, it shouldn't be hard getting an A.","I love Professor Stewart!
