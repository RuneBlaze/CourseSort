You have to be decent at writing to do well though. Overall just show up most of the time and write the papers and read/skim the books and you'll get an A","Pichova is extremely nice and helpful.","My 2nd class with Pichova; she carefully chooses readings and helps you analyze and understand them. My non-lit-major friends had a hard time with her grading, b/c there are 2 essay tests and a paper. But she's hilarious and wants you to do well, and creates a great class atmosphere for discussion. If you're into lit/slavic things, take her class!","Such a sweetheart! Classes set up kind of like a book club: she does a close reading of the text and anyone can chime in when they want (but she also doesn't care if you don't talk). Reading is very manageable and interesting. She is hilarious and brilliant and always willing to talk outside of class. Read and pay attention and you will be fine."],"courses":["GSLL235","CZCH230","CZCH470","SLAV198H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
