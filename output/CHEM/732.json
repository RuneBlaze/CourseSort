Not clear at all, did not come out of the class at al prepared for Chem 102. Wish I had known going in to wait to take it with a different professor.","He is confusing and a poor lecturer. Have to teach yourself from the textbook basically. His lectures are unorganized and his handwriting is poor. Take this class with a different professor.","Pielak is not a good lecturer and is often sometimes confusing. There are only three tests plus a final test. None of them are a walk in the park, but they aren't horribly difficult. You definitely need to study.","DO NOT TAKE PIELAK IF HES YOUR FIRST CHEM PROFESSOR!!!! It is very discouraging taking his class if you want to go into the sciences. His teaching style is all over the place and he doesn't do helpful examples, which can be hard to dive into for incoming first year students. He is also condescending at office hours.","The lectures will keep you awake but not very helpful. I recommend studying the textbook because he frequently rip questions straight from there, such as example problems of oxidation. Tests are fairly hard. And Pielak is mean at office hours. Wouldn't move my friend's exam date though he had to compete for UNC in mountain biking.","Very confusing lectures, no chance for practice problems in class, makes tests very difficult. I took AP chem and got a 3 on the exam so I took this class again for clarity, but I came out of it just as confused or maybe even a little more confused than when I signed up. Make sure you find a way to practice problems on your own.","I would never recommend taking chem 101 with him, nice guy, but no. Seriously.","I thought Pielak was a wonderful professor.  You will do well in the class if you are willing to put in the work.  He is always willing to help and even gives practice tests before each exam","The lectures weren't too bad, but he glazed over difficult topics.  The homework is not assigned, but you should do it.  I only learned and passed by reading the textbook and doing the homework.  I probably could have skipped class, read all the chapters,  and still received the same grade.","Dr. Pielak is an amazing chemist I had never taken chemistry before and found it very difficult to do well on the tests. I got a 40 on the first test, and a 44 on the second test and before college I'd never gotten a C in my life! It took me devoting my life to this class to pass it. His bellcurve encourages competition within students","Unless you had a strong background in AP Chem, get a different professor.  He teaches like you should already know material, and tests are the only grades. Never does examples in class. He holds office hours at inconvenient times, and they are rarely helpful. If you can even get his attention to answer a question, he is arrogant and disrespectful.","Pielak is far too advanced to be teaching 101. His lectures were nothing like the tests and there are only 3 with a final. An A is virtually impossible unless you are already extremely knowledgeable of the content prior to taking the course. Avoid Pielak at all costs.","I dread having a professor like Dr. Pielak again. Excellent knowledge of chemistry, but he is not willing to share it with his 101 students. He has a bitter teaching style i.e. he occasionally reprimanded students on their questions. Although he gives decent notes, they don't help at all on exams. If he's your last resort, wait another semester.","Professor Pielak was by far the worst professorteacher I have ever had. As far as lectures go, they weren't terrible. He sometimes tells you exact questions that will be on the exam. However, everything else is essentially setting you up for failure. He gives no encouragement, and doesn't actually care how well his students do. Don't take him.","Pielak is too old for teaching Chemistry. He should stay with his research. Lectures were awful, unclear. There was no assignment or quiz. He had only four exams.  Pielak is not helpful. You need to teach yourself.","Pielak's not a horrible prof, but how class is structured is difficult. Only four grades-- the 3 hour exams & the final exam. The hour exams are optional, HW is also optional. This may sound good; you might be thinking, \"YAY LESS WORK!\".. WRONG. In order to survive class, you must READ AND SELF-TEACH a lot bc he does not go over a lot of examples.","Hardest class ever, I read and did the homework and am not passing this class at the moment... You have to go to the Chem resource center every day if you even want a chance.","If you are a scientist already, and have somehow dodged taking CHEM 101 at Chapel Hill so far,  take him. A majority of people who take Professor Pielak's Chemistry class are incoming first year students that are interested in pursuing science as a profession. These students are getting shafted by an obscenely advanced teacher for an intro class.","Please don't take this man. He gives some organic chemistry level questions on his 101 exams and expects people in his class to already be masters at chemistry. He is a smart man, but that makes him really condescending when you don't understand and not very good at teaching. He is not meant for a 101 course... or probably any others.","He isn't clear in lectures and gets off topic often. He offers practice tests which don't really relate to the actual tests. Average grades for the tests were between 60 and 70 and he doesn't curve so if you do poorly you're stuck with it. However, his tests are optional and if you take all three he drops the lowest grade. Office hours are useless."],"courses":["CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","12","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101","CHEM101"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
