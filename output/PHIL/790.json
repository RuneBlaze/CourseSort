If you have to take a philosophy class for a mandatory credit you should not take this one.  The texts are not readable.  He may be a nice guy, but only if you are really interested in this topic should you take this class.","I took two classes from Lange when he was at Washington.  Inro Philosophy of Science first quarter my freshman year, in fact was the class that made me pursue a philosophy major. Lange is eccentric, brilliant, passionate about his area of study, and always willing to help a student understand.
