There are 4 papers (2 worth 10% of your grade and 2 worth 40%). The average grades were 85-95 on the 10% papers, but of course the 40% midterm was graded harder. There are so many more interesting seminars that could be taken. She is very unclear, not organized and never stays on topic.","This was a great class. Professor Perelmuter is very fair. The class consists of two paper grades and two essay format exams. Professor Perelmuter tends to give out grades anywhere in the 80s to the low 90s. She also records attendance and uses that to help raise or lower your overall average. The novels we read in class were also pretty good.","Dr. Perelmuter is really nice and takes the time to meet with confused students outside of class if they are struggling.  She comes off mildly intimidating in class, but she's actually very sweet.","I met with her to figure out which classes I needed to take over the summer to graudate. She would not count one course I had taken for my major becuase she did not feel that the course was hard enough to count- even though it was listed as a course that counted. Luckily, another advisor caught her 'mistake' and fixed it.","I don't think people that have made the previous comments have gotten to know professor Perelmuter very well. She is wonderful, very resourceful and always willing to help students. She is in my thesis committee and has been one of the most helpful persons in it. She is very knowledgeable and a great scholar.","This woman was my advisor. She almost ruined my life lying about courses. She was a pisspoor advisor. She gave me advice one day and literally the next day had vacated her office without one word. I was up the creek. She didn't mention one word the day before. She's evil, avoid her!","Dr. Perelmuter, despite her Cuban background, doesn't seem to be able to communicate effectively the causes behind many problems that plague Latin America. Our class discussions, which she tried to dominate, were meaningless and trite, and completely based on conjecture. Avoid at any cost!"],"courses":["ROML55H","ROML55H","SPAN600","ADVIS001","SPANLIT","ADVISOR","HNRS006M"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
