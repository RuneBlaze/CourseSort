It helps that it was something I was interested in - may not be the same for others. Had to do long papers but this suited me, so not too hard to get a fairly good grade.","The class itself is really boring because she talks most of the time, and the readings are required but not necessary. You can go the entire semester with out going to class and get the same grade because the papers and exam don't have anything to do with the readings. It was sort of a waste of time, honestly.","After 6 weeks,it's still unclear why we are in class. The class itself is boring and she talks for most of it. There is an extensive amount of reading and unreasonable expectations (writing a 10 page paper in a week on material we barely covered). If it weren't for requirements, I would drop the class.","We had 2 papers with 3 short response papers on the readings that we were assigned. She was really sweet and understanding. The class itself was very interesting.","We had 3 papers, but she never gave them back until after already writing the others so her comments that would have been helpful, weren't. Also had a 30 page group paper and presentation that counted 50% of the grade. Bit boring, didn't learn much from lecture, wouldn't recommend her, but if you have to have her fine.","I never thought globalization could be so painful to hear about.  Prof focuses on colonialization and rise of capitalization.  Only 2 tests, paper topics are extremely difficult, and random quizzes are given."],"courses":["ANTH484","FOLK487","ANTH484","FOLK487","ANTH059","ANTH142"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR"]}}]
