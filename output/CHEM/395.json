She really cares about her students and holds review sessions before each exam to make sure students understand the material. She gives students so many opportunities to learn the material. She made chemistry at 8AM bearable for me and she's a great lecturer.","This class was one of the best I have had at unc so far! She is a great lecturer, very specific and clear. You know what is expected of you as long as you are willing to put in the work.","Professor Dempsey gives some of the best lectures I have had at UNC. She is extremely clear on what content to go over and never demands more than you can handle. Her tests can be difficult at first, but the flipped classroom really teaches you the material so that by the final, you barely have to review the old stuff. Would definitely take again.","She's really nice and a good professor. Explains concepts clearly, I guess. I had a heavy load, so I'm sure if I would've put more effort into the class, I could've gotten an A- at least.","Gives you a lot of readingHW but breaks it down for you in class. Tests are not as hard as textbook practice problems and not too bad in general (final seems to be a bit harder than the midterms). Review sessions and her own Q&As are great. She will put a small curve (4-5 points) on midterms if need be. If you work hard you can get an A.","Professor Dempsey is awesome. So far, she's my favorite teacher here at UNC. Her lectures are extremely straightforward, and she tells you everything you need to know to succeed in her class. If one of your semester exams is lower than the final, she drops it. There are also really big review sessions before every exam. Study notes from review.","Dempsey is great. Her lectures are very clear, interactive, and interesting. Even at 8 am I never had trouble paying attention. She tells you exactly what to study and explains everything very clearly, going over multitudes of relevant practice problems. Attend her Q and A and review sessions, and do the book problems at the end.","I always feel like the science teachers at UNC are just out to fail you. However, Professor Dempsey went way out of her way to help us and make sure we succeeded. I went to her office hours once and she was a very genuine, caring woman. As mentioned, the three hour review sessions were vital! But.. I made an 89.6 and she didn't round. So that sucks","Professor Dempsey is very sweet and is very passionate about Chemistry and her students. She's very helpful and offers extra credit opportunities. Unfortunately, Chemistry is just hard. She had 3 hour review sessions for every exam including the final. She really wants her students to pass. She curves sometimes as well.","Chem 101 is definitely one of the most daunting classes at UNC but Dempsey made it as least miserable as possible.  She is entertaining and a good lecturer.  Her tests are relatively hard, but what chem tests aren't.  From what I've heard of other professors, she's the best to have for 101.","I would not recommend taking this class. Professor Dempsey is very intelligent but she is not a good professor. She does not know how to pace herself during class and ends up rushing through chapters that have significant content on the exams. She is very nice and has a passion for chemistry but is not a good professor.","She is extremely helpful and fair, especially around exam times. I always knew exactly what was going to be on her exams and what to study. Her extra assignments are easy for the most part! I have really enjoyed chemistry with Dempsey and would recommend her for any chemistry course.","Maybe the best professor I've had so far in my (albeit short) time at UNC.  Yes, the class is moderately hard, but she's one of these professors that actively finds extra time to help students, maybe more so than any of the other 101 professors this year.

He does provide a lot of review material, so definitely use that to review for tests.","Great teacher that is willing to help whenever you need it.

Overall not a tough class, you just have to be able to think about inorganic chemistry. Grading scale is adjusted. Agree w/ bottom reivew (5/8/15)","Dr. Miller is a very tough professor. The information in Chem251 is not really all that hard- only a few new topics from gen chem, but mostly  just \"gen chem on steroids.\" That being said, his tests are quite difficult and designed to trick you. He doesn't curve, but does change the grading scale (90-100 A, 87-89  A-). The final was very hard.","CHEM 251 is a two credit hour course. He structured the course so there are two lectures each week with an optional problem session (usually Fridays). The grade was mostly based on homework and test grades. There were a couple extra credit options.","Dr. Miller is extremely nice for how smart he is.  He explains concepts well, although the teaching pace is fast and the book wasn't as detailed as his lectures.  He definitely cares if his students are learning but his tests are challenging. The practice problems in the book do not reflect his exams and that's mainly the only extra practice...","He was a great teacher who was very interested in having students succeed and getting them interested in research.

Generous curve as well. Recommend!","Never heard of Glish prior to taking his Chem 241 class, but he quickly turned into my favorite teacher at UNC.  Must do all readings and work tons of problems.  Very approachable if you have any questions and is fair about point-spreads and test curves.  Tests will challenge you and you review old material for the final. Got a B. Recommend.","If he taught just a little bit, he'd make this class less painful. During lectures, he basically goes over the content of his power point slides... I don't think, he realizes how much hatred he induces in us towards the course.","I had Glish back in the day.  He looked at my grades and said there were no way I could get an A.

He doesn't teach well at all.","As far as chem classes go this one was great. Jorgenson writes everything he's talking about on the board, which means its easy to follow and you have plenty of time to take notes. The tests are all multiple choice and they are almost identical to the practice exams. He also lets you replace exam grades with sections of the final which is nice.","Jorgenson has been my favorite professor so far at UNC. Cutest and funniest old man ever. I want to adopt him as my grandpa. Go to class and take good notes, do practice problems and practice exams - you'll be good to go. I even went to a couple of his office hours (basically Q&A sessions) and it helped a ton! Definitely recommend!","He is the cutest old man and is very famous in analytical chemistry. Easiest chem class I have taken. Tests are very similar to his practice exams. Sometimes he just changes the numbers. His lectures are boring and he is a little hard to hear & the textbook is useless (but do the problems he assigns). You can redeem yourself on the final!!","This class was a bore. Poor Jorgenson because he is a really nice man, but the class was so boring that I never went. The final was extremely hard. There isn't much more to say. Chem 241 was one of the worst classes I took here. The only good thong is that he will replace your exam grades with how well you did on final, except the final blows.","He is a great lecturer and goes by a very traditional chalkboard teach method. I would recommend going to his office hours and really studying the practice tests. Even though he is really successful and distinguished in his field, Dr. Jorgenson is so humble and approachable. He will not be teaching for much longer so take his class whe you can!","Great professor. Study your notes and do the practice exams and the assigned problems and you will be fine. I love him, he is adorable and known a lot. I admire him :)","Dr. Jorgenson was great!  I don't know what's up with these other comments, but he was clear, funny, and knew the material well!  Tests were fair, if you went to lecture and did the practice problems, it wasn't too hard to get an A on his exams.  That said, like any chemistry class, going to lecture and doing the homework is easier said than done.","Professor Jorgenson is an AMAZING professor!  He was hilarious!  He did multiple choice tests.  This was my favorite class!  He told stories during his lectures to keep you engaged and they helped you remember the stuff.  I LOVED THIS CLASS!  He is a great man and a great professor.

If you take his class, be prepared to teach yourself and get a good tutor.","Worst professor I've ever had at UNC...or anywhere for that matter.

Go to office hours, as he is extremely understanding and helpful.  Many of these professors push off extra teaching/help to TA's, but he cares about his students for review sessions. Rough class but no tests have curveballs, just need lots of time to study","I got an A in 261 with Crimmins and now an A in 262 with him again. By far the best organic chemistry professor at UNC. However, don't let you think that this is a walk in the park - you still have to do your part to get the grade you want. 262 in my opinion was harder than 262, and the average in the class was also lower than 261. Mike is awesome!","Dr. Crimmins is by far the best science professor I've had here because he is FAIR and doesn't try to trick you like so many others. At the same time though, fair definitely doesn't mean easy, but there's nothing easy about Organic chemistry anyways. Take him! You'll regret it if you don't because he's such an awesome guy.","Crimmins is one of the best professors I have had thus far. He genuinely wants all his students to do well and will do whatever he can to get you your best grade at the end of the semester. Go to his office hours; he dedicates so much of his time outside of class to helping students! He is the best organic professor.","One of the best professors I've ever had.  He teaches the material extremely well.  Just watch the videos, show up to class, and work the practice tests religiously and you will do well.","Best professor ever - I love Mike Crimmins. Tests are very straightforward and fair, but partial credit is minimal to non-existent so you need to know your stuff.","Dr. Crimmins is a phenomenal teacher. He is really engaging in class and gives students lots of outside resources like videos and practice problems. He gives his students all the things they need to be successful, but they have to study and work too. That's just the reality with Orgo. Definitely one of the best teachers I've had at UNC.","Has an online library of videos explaining the topics in his class. He or his class mentors are often available for help.","He is super easy to talk to and he respects his students. It is easy to get one on one help with either Crimmins or the TAs. He posts lots of helpful resources on the course site. Tests are hard, but they are fairly written. Best professor I've had at UNC hands down.","He's a really nice guy. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class. There's textbook readings and videos to watch. There's a clicker quiz every day, and you get to talk to your neighbors about questions, which is always nice. He gives practice tests, which are helpful. The content is pretty hard and requires good 3D-visualization skills.","If you have the opportunity to take organic chemistry (1, 2 ,or both) with Dr. Crimmins, do it. Definitely the best chemistry professor I have had at UNC. He is great at explaining concepts, knows how to write fair exams, and is truly a good guy.","Honestly the BEST professor I have ever had at UNC. His expectations for class are very clear and if you trust him and does what he says you WILL succeed. Tests are very fair and similar to practice exams. Offers plenty of extra help sessions. The workload is very reasonable for Orgo 1. To top it all off he is genuinely nice person who really cares","I'm not sure what changed between 2007 and when he came back to teaching in 2014, but I don't even recognize the person the other comments are describing. His lectures are very clear and concise. You can tell he puts a lot of time into organizing material into a way that will make the most sense. He has weekly Q&A sessions and last minute reviews.","Professor Crimmins was an extremely passionate teacher. He actually cares about students understanding chemistry, and it shows in how much effort he puts into making his lectures clear. His outlines are a little harder to follow but they really aren't necessary if you pay attention and read the book beforehand. Use the book! It helped a lot","He is very engaging and seems invested in students learning the material. The material by default is relatively difficult but his lectures are organized to teach you efficiently and he offers weekly review sessions. Tests can be hard, but its very similar to the problems in the text book. He's definitely the best chem professor I've had here.","He is friendly and his lectures are clear. His online videos are pretty helpful. He offers Q&A sessions every week.","Seriously, how does Prof. Crimmins have bad reviews?? He's an awesome lecturer, great at explaining the material, always willing to help during office hours, and he's funny. I guess I can see how others might find him condescending, but it's just because he wants you to do well. Take Crimmins. He rocks.","I agree-Crimmins is a condescending jerk-he doesn't seem to have much use for pre-med students or people who won't kiss his butt. He is definitely one of those professors who is more interested in his research than teaching. He doesn't make time to help those for whom orgo doesn't come naturally. Can't imagine being a grad student in that lab.","I found Crimmins to be engaging, but he was often condescending towards the class. He has very high expectations and knows his class is hard... probably prides himself on it. Good jokes, though. Not horrible, but not fantastic either.","Nice guy.  The lectures were excellent, he had the whole class laughing on multiple occasions.  Of course, it is OChem II, so it is quite difficult.

She was very enthusiastic, as she herself had pioneered fluorescence techniques.  She was very patient, explained the technical aspects of microscopy with great clarity &  taught us to read scientific literature with a critical eye.","Very boring lecturer, doesn't know what she is talking about sometimes.  If you read the book and do the mastering you will pass without going to a single lecture.  Powerpoints are all posted online","You don't learn anything in this class. She rambles on abut things that don't pertain to what you need to learn and her tests are extra hard for no reason. She even said she made the test too long for the time we are given and still made us take the test. I would not take her as a professor at all. Avoid at all costs","This is literally the worst teacher I've had at Carolina. I did well in the class, but I worked harder in this class than I did in Math 383- Differential Equations. You basically have to teach yourself everything. She is not clear and you can tell that she doesn't care. Avoid her like the plague.","Worst professor possible.  You don't receive formula sheets, she doesn't provide practice tests, and she acts dismissive in office hours.  ANYONE would be better than Thompson.  Tests are 10+ pages with the final exam over 20 pages long.  The kicker is that she's tough and you don't learn anything since she reads off of the powerpoint.","Terrible professor. She provides no practice tests or even study guides for her exams. She does the bare minimum for the course. Her lectures are dull and monotone and she never clearly articulates what you should know. Would definitely not recommend her unless you enjoy learning everything on your own.","I would avoid taking this class. The lectures do not help at all, but luckily attendance is not required.

Wish I had known going in to wait to take it with a different professor.","He is confusing and a poor lecturer. Have to teach yourself from the textbook basically. His lectures are unorganized and his handwriting is poor. Take this class with a different professor.","Pielak is not a good lecturer and is often sometimes confusing. There are only three tests plus a final test. None of them are a walk in the park, but they aren't horribly difficult. You definitely need to study.","DO NOT TAKE PIELAK IF HES YOUR FIRST CHEM PROFESSOR!!!! It is very discouraging taking his class if you want to go into the sciences. His teaching style is all over the place and he doesn't do helpful examples, which can be hard to dive into for incoming first year students. He is also condescending at office hours.","The lectures will keep you awake but not very helpful. I recommend studying the textbook because he frequently rip questions straight from there, such as example problems of oxidation. Tests are fairly hard. And Pielak is mean at office hours. Wouldn't move my friend's exam date though he had to compete for UNC in mountain biking.","Very confusing lectures, no chance for practice problems in class, makes tests very difficult. I took AP chem and got a 3 on the exam so I took this class again for clarity, but I came out of it just as confused or maybe even a little more confused than when I signed up. Make sure you find a way to practice problems on your own.","I would never recommend taking chem 101 with him, nice guy, but no. Seriously.","I thought Pielak was a wonderful professor.  You will do well in the class if you are willing to put in the work.  He is always willing to help and even gives practice tests before each exam","The lectures weren't too bad, but he glazed over difficult topics.  The homework is not assigned, but you should do it.  I only learned and passed by reading the textbook and doing the homework.  I probably could have skipped class, read all the chapters,  and still received the same grade.","Dr. Pielak is an amazing chemist I had never taken chemistry before and found it very difficult to do well on the tests. I got a 40 on the first test, and a 44 on the second test and before college I'd never gotten a C in my life! It took me devoting my life to this class to pass it. His bellcurve encourages competition within students","Unless you had a strong background in AP Chem, get a different professor.  He teaches like you should already know material, and tests are the only grades. Never does examples in class. He holds office hours at inconvenient times, and they are rarely helpful. If you can even get his attention to answer a question, he is arrogant and disrespectful.","Pielak is far too advanced to be teaching 101. His lectures were nothing like the tests and there are only 3 with a final. An A is virtually impossible unless you are already extremely knowledgeable of the content prior to taking the course. Avoid Pielak at all costs.","I dread having a professor like Dr. Pielak again. Excellent knowledge of chemistry, but he is not willing to share it with his 101 students. He has a bitter teaching style i.e. he occasionally reprimanded students on their questions. Although he gives decent notes, they don't help at all on exams. If he's your last resort, wait another semester.","Professor Pielak was by far the worst professorteacher I have ever had. As far as lectures go, they weren't terrible. He sometimes tells you exact questions that will be on the exam. However, everything else is essentially setting you up for failure. He gives no encouragement, and doesn't actually care how well his students do. Don't take him.","Pielak is too old for teaching Chemistry. He should stay with his research. Lectures were awful, unclear. There was no assignment or quiz. He had only four exams.  Pielak is not helpful. You need to teach yourself.","Pielak's not a horrible prof, but how class is structured is difficult. Only four grades-- the 3 hour exams & the final exam. The hour exams are optional, HW is also optional. This may sound good; you might be thinking, \"YAY LESS WORK!\".. WRONG. In order to survive class, you must READ AND SELF-TEACH a lot bc he does not go over a lot of examples.","Hardest class ever, I read and did the homework and am not passing this class at the moment... You have to go to the Chem resource center every day if you even want a chance.","If you are a scientist already, and have somehow dodged taking CHEM 101 at Chapel Hill so far,  take him. A majority of people who take Professor Pielak's Chemistry class are incoming first year students that are interested in pursuing science as a profession. These students are getting shafted by an obscenely advanced teacher for an intro class.","Please don't take this man. He gives some organic chemistry level questions on his 101 exams and expects people in his class to already be masters at chemistry. He is a smart man, but that makes him really condescending when you don't understand and not very good at teaching. He is not meant for a 101 course... or probably any others.","He isn't clear in lectures and gets off topic often. He offers practice tests which don't really relate to the actual tests. Average grades for the tests were between 60 and 70 and he doesn't curve so if you do poorly you're stuck with it. However, his tests are optional and if you take all three he drops the lowest grade.

I made the mistake of underestimating that on the first exam and got in the 70s. 90+ on everything after that","Redinbo is a great professor and easy to listen to. Also, he takes the relevant material and puts it into clear, easy-to-read outlines and posts them.  They essentially tell you what will be on an exam. Exams are fair (all free response).  Class is mostly memorization. If you want to think more deeply about biochem, take an honors section.","One of the best professors I've learned from at UNC. If you're good at memorization, then expect an A. This guy is funny. He is great at simplifying things. This class is crossed-sect. with biol 430.

Moreover, I actually enjoy lectures.","Super hot, funny, and overall easy teacher - take him for biochem for sure","He's a funny guy. Keeps you awake.

Its only a 2 unit course, so there's not much material compared to other chems. I took it with the lab and the work load wasn't bad. There are no assignments due, just tests.

Goes through the material rather quickly, but has Q/A sessions after class to clear things up. Tests were very fair. Questions came right from the practice problems most of the time.

If you are good at math then this class should be relatively easy. There is no homework grade, but non of the tests were exceptionally difficult. I would recommend this teacher over all the other 102 teachers.","There is a difference between being a good person and being a good professor. His class was very hard. Your grade is based off of three exams and the final- nothing else! If you do better on the final than on one of the exams, he'll drop that one and replace it with the final exam's. He makes his tests difficult. Pick another professor if you can.","Professor Weeks was a great teacher. He's really passionate about what he teaches and he makes it interesting. The tests are very similar to the h.w. problems, so if you do them, and read the chapters, the class is very do-able. You can get a solid B putting in about 70% effort. So, giving it your all can probably get you an A! :)","Professor Weeks is a good professor. He provides notes that you can print out and fill in in class and his tests are VERY similar to the practice problems done in class and the book problems he suggests doing.  Do the book problems and review the class problems and you should be fine.","Took quantitative analysis, 2nd semester gen chem.  Printable lecture notes which really helped out.  Walks through several problems in class.  Know your homework problems b/c test are very similar.  Average test scores in 60-ish range, curved grade by 2-3 points in the end but depends on class average.","Very hard, make sure you go to class and work the practice problems.......lucky for me he curved!","No Comments","I thought his lectures were clear and fairly interesting.  Sometimes he seems a bit curt or dismissive in answering questions, but I don't think he's trying to be mean.  He'll walk you through something, which some people find condescending.

I wouldn't recommend taking this class because as a pair, Bloom and Dangl make this class very difficult to understand","I'm a double science major and Bloom's class was by far my easiest science class at UNC.  He teaches the complicated parts patiently and the practice tests he gives are very helpful.  Do the practice tests and go to review sessions and this class is no problem.","The material isn't easy, but he's very approchable for questions after class.","I did not think either Kerry Bloom or Jeff Dangl were effective teachers. This class contains difficult material and I would advise taking it with someone else.","Somewhat scatterbrained, but generally a good teacher. Stops frequently for questions and goes slowly through difficult material, very much unlike his colleague (and co-professor) Jeff Dangl. Average-difficulty or difficult tests. Likes what he does, so learning from him is a bit easier."],"courses":["BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL202","BIO50","BIOL50","BIOL50","BIO50"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
