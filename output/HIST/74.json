The FYS that I had with her was an amazing experience. The class was really easy with only a few assignments. The readings were difficult and often lengthy but not mandatory or necessary for understanding lecture. We did so many interesting things like movies,  museums and musical performances."],"courses":["HIST89"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
