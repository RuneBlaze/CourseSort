Henning was good one-on-one, but in the lecture hall is not too exciting to listen to. He'll tell you what you need to know but doesn't try to make it exciting for you. He also often rants on about why he's teaching how he's teaching instead of just teaching. He'll get the point across, but could easily just do it in fewer words.","Smart and funny guy who is really willing to work with you to help you figure things out.","Professor Henning is about as engaging a physics teacher can get. The lectures go by pretty fast. He's funny which makes the class better along with his ability to explain things. Definitely recommend.","There is a lot of homework. The lectures involve clickers and group disucssions, making it engaging. The labs can be a drag sometimes. There's a lot of material to cover, so it's important to make sure you don't get behind. He explains things pretty clearly.","Professor Henning certainly maximizes his 50 minutes.  Peppered with quirky physics humor, his teaching style is straightforward and well-paced. If you ever find yourself with a question, he happily spends a few minutes discussing it during or after class.  Certainly a good lecturer and highly recommend him for your physics course needs!","Dr. Henning worked hard to ensure the material was better explained and more intuitive than previous introductory level physics classes , and he largely succeeded. The class was difficult, but he seems to be working diligently to continually improve the course. Besides first time kinks, he has created an exemplary model for science classes."],"courses":["PHYS119","PHYS118","PHYS119","PHYS118","PHYS118","PHYS118"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"PHYS","catalog_nbr":118,"section":503,"class_nbr":8651,"title":"MECHANICS AND RELATIVITY","component":"Lab","units":0,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0208","days":"MW","time":"14","instructor":"DEARDORFF,DUANE L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["PX"],"enrl_cap":45,"enrl_tot":44,"wait_cap":10,"wait_tot":1,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=652801","fname":"Duane","lname":"Deardorff","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.7","help":"3.7","clarity":"3.7","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"3.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["I do not like him.
