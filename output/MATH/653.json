Though his class was very difficult, he curves a lot and has become one of my favorite teachers at Chapel Hill. Do not be scared by a low test grade with him, because he will curve your final grade up and he will always be there to help you. Take this teacher.","Marzuola is great! Yeah, his tests are hard, but he curves them, so even if you get a 52 (like I did) he'll round it up to a B if you're close enough to the average. Homework was VERY long, took more than 10 hours a week to complete. He's a very good lecturer and has lots of times for office hours, so you can (and should) get extra help if needed.","He seems to have a solid understanding of what he teaches, but is not exactly proficient at communicating ideas easily for students who are learning the difficult concepts for the first time.","Jeremy seems like a very very good teacher. For higher level maths. I think his niche just resides in graduate level classes, not differential equations. He is super into what he teaches, but he gets almost too into topics that make some things confusing. I'd look forward to taking him in a higher math class though."],"courses":["MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH383"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
