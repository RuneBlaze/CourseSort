Because they are musicianship skill classes, you should be prepared to sing and hearing parts as they become progressively difficult. Overall, Weisert is one of my favorite professors that I have had the pleasure to work with.","Great guy, lighthearted and not difficult. Very reasonable in his assignments. Besides composition projects, we only had a couple of online readings that were useful and relavent. Not the MOST helpful when you need it, but it doesn't really matter because you never really need it!","Very nice guy, willing to help, but hard to schedule time for out of class help."],"courses":["MUSC130","MUSC239","MUSC130"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
