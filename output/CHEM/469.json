If you're looking for clarity, you'll get it here. He's helpful in office hours too. 3 exams were difficult but you are able to drop one, and the final was very fair.","Nicewicz is a good professor, but you cannot get by in this class simply by going to lectures. Lectures are a very brief, one-time overview of material. He writes everything on the board which is great...but you must go home, read the book, work the problems, and rework the problems again if you want to succeed. Orgo is a really difficult class.","Dr. Nicewicz was great for Orgo I. He was incredibly clear and did his best to acknowledge and answer all questions. The exams and grading were fair and true to the book and class; however, don't mistake this to mean that they are easy--it's orgo at UNC. If you READ the book thoroughly, do LOTS of practice, and ask questions, an A is attainable.","I had Nicewicz for Orgo 2 and he is an amazing prof. His lectures were always crystal clear and he answers questions really well. He is a nice guy that is extremely helpful in class and in office hours. His tests were fair overall and he did give a generous curve at the end. I would highly recommend taking Nicewicz for organic.","Dave is hilarious!!!"],"courses":["CHEM261H","CHEM261","CHEM261","CHEM262","CHEM400"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
