Incredibly knowledgable, passionate, entertaining, and helpful. An advocate for you as a student in the classroom and with any reference need. His course on Crime and Punishment is fantastic and spans U.S. policy and culture of punishment from Salem in 1692 to the War on Drugs.","Awesome professor who is definitely passionate about what he is teaching. He likes learning with his students - and from them - and he is going to expect some participation from you, not yo bother you but because he considers it to be an important part of the class. Do your readings, show interest and be present and you'll pass the class!","Do yourself a favor and take a class with Seth! He's incredibly knowledgeable and hilarious, and he's always concerned with the students' opinions/ideas. The class is extremely discussion-based, but the topics are generally so interesting that everyone wants to contribute. Also, he more or less had us design our own final, which was awesome.","Hands down one of the best professors I've ever had.  He's incredibly intelligent, he's funny, and he knew everybody in my class' name by the end of the first week, as well as a few things about each of us personally.  Didn't even care about the topic, but I'm considering taking another class with him just because I enjoyed my time there.","Professor Kotch leads a thought provoking and interesting class. He has a ton of cool anecdotes and is pretty laid back and easy to talk to. Class is INCREDIBLY discussion based, so be prepared to talk. Participation is 10% of your grade! No textbook, and not much homework besides small readings before class. Not much homework. My favorite class!"],"courses":["AMST292","AMST202","AMST292","AMST89","AMST202"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
