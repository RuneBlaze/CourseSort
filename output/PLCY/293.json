Her lectures are interesting and she very clearly outlines her expectations for all assignments. If you put in the work, you will get a good grade.","Dr. KL is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Inspired me to be a Public Policy major. She's very friendly and helpful during office hours as well. Despite the class being 200+ people, she made an effort to learn as many names as possible and her lecture activities made the class feel smaller.","AWESOME PROFESSOR. Her lectures are interesting and she really cares about your learning. Not a lot of work, minus a 15 pg paper at the end. This is a really cool class for any major. Use your best judgment to decide if you should actually read the assigned reading; half the time you need to, half the time you don't.","Professor KL is super personable and makes lectures interesting. She makes an effort to get to know students, and get them to participate in class. However, her class is a bit like high school as TAs constantly walk around the room trying to bust students using their phones. Make sure you attend class, as she does polls and will not post slides.","She's so helpful. Would totally take PLCY 101 again. She has a crazy ability to remember all 200 people's names in the class. It's kind of scary. Annakl is a boss!","She was an amazing professor and was always there to help! She is also a genius!","Dr. Krome-Lukens is very personable and her class is very interesting. However, she is a very harsh grader and will take off points for little things. There is only two tests - the final and midterm, so most of your grade comes from blog posts. Make sure to take them very seriously.","Dr. KL is honestly one of the best professors I've had. She is very passionate about history but makes it interesting. She genuinely cares about how well you do in the class and will respond to any emails you send her (I sent many). Her assignments are not too much and she is a very fair grader. Definitely take her for HIST 128!!","Dr. KL is passionate about history and it shows. Her lectures are packed with information that will be vital for both tests. She assigns a good bit of reading and expects class participation but if you do what's assigned, it shouldn't be too hard to succeed. Overall, the work pays off and you walk away knowing a lot more than you did before.","always willing to help- only hard part is all of her teaching is lecture so you have to pay close attention"],"courses":["PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","HIST128","HIST128","128","HIST128","HIST128"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
