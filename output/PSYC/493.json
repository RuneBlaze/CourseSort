The class was interesting but wasn't enough to hold my attention that well. Lots of online assignments and beware new people taking his class: he doesn't give you hints for when stuff is due. A lot of group work and his big project is ridiculous. Make sure you pick a team that wants a great grade.","LOVED him. Great professor and really made the material come to life and interesting.","He is an awesome professor. There are many assignments, but they are really helpful. You will learn a lot throughout the semester.","Buzinski is a pretty funny guy, he makes the lectures enjoyable. He gives a lot of extra credit opportunities, definitely do all of them. Do not forget to complete his quizzes on Sakai, I missed two and my grade definitely hurt from that. He assigns one big project, it's pretty intense for the level of the class but not impossible to do well on it.","Awesome professor with interesting lectures.  Read the book and do the worksheets and you'll do good on the exams.  Two question quiz at the beginning of every class-easy points to boost your grade.  The group project is the worst part of the class and was 17% of the grade.  If there wasn't a group project, I would take another one of his classes.","He's a pretty good professor. Probably not my favorite, but he's an approachable person. Definitely eye-candy and great to listen to, but sometimes I'd be a little confused at the concepts he would explain. We had probably 4 guest lecturers (3 TA's) which really influenced Test 2 badly for me (multiple perspectives). Overall, I'd recommend.","Dr. Buzinski is my favorite professor at UNC! His classes are a lot of work but he's really good at making the subject interesting and engaging so that you actually want to do the work! He's friendly and has a great class structure that places a lot of emphasis on interacting with the students rather than a 50 minute lecture. I highly recommend him","Best class i have taken here with the best professor. He is really engaging and relatable. Also super cute and funny. Keeps you awake and engaged at 8 AM.","Great Professor! Has graded worksheets online that help your grade if you've done the reading. Has good explanations for the different concepts and really likes to make sure the class understands the concepts through questions or group work."],"courses":["PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC222","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYCH222","PSYCH101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
