You really explored yourself and personal boundaries. Professor Page is loosy-goosy with her guidelines for photos, so you have alot of freedom in making your photos. It was fun.","Super enthusiastic and fun. Always helpful and open to everything. Likes work to be a bit edgy. Crits to makes you better not a bunch of fluff. Overall awesome woman.
