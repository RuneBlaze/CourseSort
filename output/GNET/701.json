Super knowledgeable on anything you ask, and if he doesn't know, he will do some research and answer your question the next lecture. Instead of a textbook he gives super specific weekly notes on topics he will cover. Always super available for questions and will make sure you understand everything. Definitely recommend!!","Excellent professor. He gives detailed lectures and does a great job of explaining material. The course is a lot of information, but he presents everything well. There is no textbook for this course, so you must go to lectures to learn. If you are at all interested in genetics, definitely take this course!","This class is very well taught and interesting. If you are at all interested in human genetics, I highly recommend this course. It's not super difficult, but you need to study and allocate some time to work on the problem sets. Dr. Sekelsky is really helpful. He posts lecture notes online that are really great to supplement your class notes.","Very intersting class and prof.   Very helpful and STRAIGHTFOWARD and funny. Great class","Engaging lecturer, very clear about what will and will not be on tests","Nice guy, actually tests on what he teaches","Interacts with the class well and always willing to go back and answer questions in the middle of the lecture.  Tests go along with the lectures."],"courses":["BIOL425","BIOL425","BIOL425","BIO122","BIO50","BIOL50","BIOL50"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
