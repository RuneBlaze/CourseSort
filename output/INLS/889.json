She really has a way with words and her linguistic skill makes her lectures all the more engaging. She treats her students fairly and although some of the work she assigns can be challenging, she's not a \"hard\" teacher. I would take a million more classes with her!","Haas expects mastery of databases from students immediately, even though this is databases I. We spent so little time on the fundamentals that it made the rest of the assignments (which build) nearly impossible. The assignments didn't build logically and I found her unnecessarily punitive in grading work.","Intro to DB is a tough class, textbook is hard, but Haas does what she can to make it understandable. VERY hard homework, but she spent 2 hours outside class to help me understand it, and I appreciated it. Tough but fair.","Stephanie is one the finest professors around! Don't miss and opportunity to take a class with her.","Very Interesting.  Dry humor","Probably the best professor I've ever had, in 3 college degrees! Take ANYTHING you can from her! She is not apushover, but you appreciate her difficulty because it makes you work. She is a very sweet person and extremely helpful outside of class for anything you need. I would almost go back to school just to take her classes again."],"courses":["INLS202","INLS523","INLS523","INLS512","LIBS0","INLS176ETAL"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
