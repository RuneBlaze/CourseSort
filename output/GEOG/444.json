He wasn't very helpful even when contacted multiple times.","He was the most disorganized and least helpful professor I have had at UNC so far.","I recommend this class to everyone as it's relevant to everyone. It was a fairly depressing class--global warming and all--but I learned a lot. It was definitely not easy. I busted by tail for a B+, but I enjoyed it. He's laid back w/ a California accent, sitting cross-legged on the desk, cracking jokes. And he's really interested in the material.","Dr. Moody is interesting, funny, and knows what he's talking about. If you're interested in environmental science, definately take this course.","Dr. Moody is really engaging - his classes are a hoot! He may not always be organized but he always interesting material to present. Plus, he is a total hottie!!!","This class was a total waste of time.  no organization in his teaching.  no use of books assigned, thus lecture is always mandatory, yet you never know what will be included on the tests.  he goes off on tangents and tests you on them.  Do Not Take One Of His Classes!"],"courses":["GEOG110","GEOG110","GEOG212","GEOG12","GEOG12","GEOG12"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
