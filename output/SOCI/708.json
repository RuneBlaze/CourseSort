I got an A, but I felt confused 99% of the time.","Professor Cai is skilled when discussing or using data analysis software. What he could stand to improve from is articulating concepts and relating them back to the class example. There were lots of times someone asked a question and he would answer in a detailed and unspecific way you wouldn't remember what the original question was. Read the book","The course is basically the textbook. Some questions were literally copied from it. HIs accent makes it hard to understand what he is trying to say occasionally. Despite all this, he is very knowledgeable in his field, ties the subject matter to his background well, and is very fair."],"courses":["SOCI252","SOCI250","SOCI121"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
