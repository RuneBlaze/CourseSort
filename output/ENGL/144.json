Always available to talk before or after class and in her office hours. If you are thinking about taking 105i, TAKE BUSI 105i it is unbelievably easy. The most I wrote for an assignment was maybe two pages.","Super exciting and makes not so interesting material interesting. Really love her class and would take it again just for fun. Helpful, never patronizing (even if you ask a dumb question). Quizzes are super easy. Overall great professor and person","Professor Geil is the best! I took her for Popular Genres and it was my favorite class at UNC. She is very excited about teaching the class and willing to work with you if you need a deadline extension or something. Her quizzes are so easy and the class is actually fun. She grades on participation, so make sure to raise your hand. Highly recommend!","AMAZING professor!! she's flexible and understanding, but also sets reasonable expectations that aren't impossible to meet. She's open-minded and always willing to help a student.","I've only been at Chapel Hill for one semester, but thus far she is my FAVORITE professor by far. She makes class fun by being herself--which is corky and funny. She's a nerd and won't deny it. She's super understanding, helpful and encouraging. The biggest assignments we had were 7-8 paged paper and a group project. Fun class, fun teacher.","I took ENGL 105i - Writing in Business with Dr. Geil and it was a wonderful experience. I thought the class was very useful and I developed writing skills relevant to my future career. We also had a mock Shark Tank presentation, which was actually quite fun to work on. Learned a lot from Dr. Geil, guest presenters she brought in and my classmates.","Attendance is a must. Fair grader, very approachable and friendly. Two papers: One group based paper (5-6 pg) and Final paper (9-10 pg). Weekly quizzes-only to help boost your grade. 8-9 plays over the semester. Midterm: Snow days were a factor, so we had to write essays based on prompts. More  than likely you will take the standard midterm.","Dr. Geil was a wonderful and engaging instructor. She was willing to help with anything you needed and always took everyone in the classes' opinions into consideration. She illuminated the material in a way that seemed interesting to the whole class. (Oh, and she was occasionally hilarious.)","Take everything she teaches. She's funny and really knows her stuff. She pushed both papers back almost two weeks, and held extensive reviews for the midterm and final. Weekly quizzes are a great way to bolster your grade, and she drops the lowest one. She was always available for help with papers, and she'll even send promising sources your way.","Dr. Geil was so helpful and she was so entertaining. She kept her demeanor friendly and she was a bit quirky. She grades strictly, but fairly. The course was incredibly interesting and she was the primary reason for keeping it interesting as Shakespeare is sometimes difficult to grasp. I would absolutely recommend taking her class if you can."],"courses":["ENG105I","ENGL120","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL105","225","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENGL225"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
