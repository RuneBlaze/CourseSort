I had her for MATH 119 and she taught very in depth, and even showed us how to use excel. Easy to get an A if you study a couple hours for each exam. We also did a lot of group work. Homework was rarely collected, but was sometimes used in class for group work (again, a lot of it).","loved her... super helpful and a good person","This class was the easiest thing ever, i guess because i had taken calc 2. The homework and assignments were tedious, required a lot of effort but were barely worth anything. As a person who already knew the material, i think that she her explanations were kinda confusing and took the long route in solving problems. Barely used the text book .","Probably one of the easiest classes I've taken at UNC.  If you don't have to take an upper level math, definitely take this class. She also teaches you how to use Excel, which is a bonus.","You will probably learn more practical information taking this class with her than with anyone else.  The drawback is you will put in twice the amount of effort into this course and probably get a lower grade than you would taking this course with anyone else.","This was a difficult course for me because I hadn't had a math course in 2 years.  She explained things pretty well and actually seems to care about her students.  The course was rushed because it was during a summer session, but she managed to get all the material in."],"courses":["MATH119","MATH130","MATH119","MATH119","MATH119","MATH130"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
