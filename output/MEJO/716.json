Tests are very hard, and the paper is ridiculous.  I didn't take as much away from the course as I wanted to.  She's a good professor, but don't take this course unless you're ready to work.","critical response paper was ridiculous. i have never done as poorly on any paper in my entire academic career. she's nice enough, but tests are also extremely difficult","for Fall2006, she was EXCELLENT in grading our final. we were having trouble with the 3 short answer Qs, so if we got a 3, 5, and 7 (out of 10) on them, she took the highest (7) and multiplied it by 3 for our grade. With IDs- she was &quot;VERY generous&quot; with what she accepted as the answer, and the minimum she allowed a student to get was a 24/30.","Interesting lectures, class is not bad to sit through.  Tests are absolutely ridiculous though. She tests 30% from the book and the chapters are long.  Our final was over ten chapters and the class average was a 68.  Be careful on her critical response paper, she grades really really ridiculously!  I wouldn't take another one of her classes ever!!!","She is nice and the class is not that bad.  However,  the tests are extremely hard; the class average on the final was a 70.3. The textbook reading is long, general and boring, but the test questions are very specific and ambiguous.  This class was harder than my chem, phil, and clar.","Prof. Johnston is a great teacher.  Her class is very sraight forward and all you have to do is show up to ensure a good grade on the tests.  She goes over everything you will need to know for the test in class. Great teacher!","Dr. Johnston is a very nice woman, and the class is fairly enjoyable to take.  However, she is an extremely tough grader and her tests are HARD!  She can also be a little confusing when you look for direction in your papers, and there is a lot of reading."],"courses":["JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC101","JOMC11","JOMC11","JOMC115","JOMC115"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
