It was Tu/Th so Tuesdays we had discussions (just participate once for credit) then Thursdays were presentations (each student presents twice throughout the semester). Only one 2-paragraph paper due each week and he gave A's out like candy. Definitely take his class.","Probably one of the most boring classes I have ever taken. Dominguez is a really nice guy, but seems to think everyone in the class has an extensive prior knowledge of Spain in the Middle Ages. I did poorly in the class all semester (mainly because I was bored by the material), but the final was 50% of the overall grade and was surprisingly easy.","Took SPAN 101 in the summer with him so I went everyday and he I have to say the constant repetition gets old, but he made sure everything was clear. He provided a very solid base of understanding. Only negative was that he is kinda particular on the tests but he occasionally miscounts how many points should be taken off.","The lectures were pretty dry and boring, and he posts an excessive amount of articles on Blackboard (I'm sure no one read them all - who had the time&#63;). The class is slightly disorganized but manageable.  I didn't enjoy the course, but I have nothing but good things to say about Dominguez. Very approachable/kind/equitable. But I must say: easy A.","Dr. Dominguez rules my world!!!!  He is such an amazing person, and a great professor.  He also puts all of the readings online (for 371 as well), so no book.  His quizzes are hard, but the exams are easy. He is wonderfully easygoing and passionate about his subject matter.  I would take 20 million more classes with him if I could!","I disliked this class at first because he is boring and I couldn't read the texts, but it started to grow on me. He explains the material well, and has a grading system that basically ensures that an honest effort will get you an &quot;A&quot;. The quizzes are hard, but the exams are easy. Really a low key, easy-going professor who cares about his students."],"courses":["SPAN350","SPAN371","SPAN101","SPAN383","SPAN383","SPAN371"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
