The lectures are very unclear. All learning must be done independently from the book. Avoid taking a course with him if possible.","Professor Adalsteinsson is really nice and always there to help you. However, he seems to lack the ability to pacing the course smoothly. He sometimes could not finish what he plans to discuss and only give you a very short time on worksheets(yes, worksheets, but they are generally easy). Still, the course and the tests are the easiest I've taken.","He is a nice guy, and I won't say he intentionally does this. However, one thing I never really understood was that he seemed not to focus on testing our understanding over the course, but our ability to caculate VERY tedious problems in a given period of time. I knew how to solve all the problems on my final, but was not able to finish it on time.","He is a bit confusing in class and overcomplicates some things. However, one on one he is very helpful and he is the nicest guy ever. He wants you to do well so if you go find him you will. That being said, he may not respond his emails so you need to go to office hours if you need help.","Dude makes no sense when he is teaching. Noone in the class can understand any concepts unless they have been taught them by someone else before. Very hard to follow, has a lot of trouble explaining concepts and theories on levels for students to learn."],"courses":["MATH547","MATH383","MATH547","MATH547","MATH547"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":547,"section":2,"class_nbr":2539,"title":"LINEAR ALGEBRA FOR APPL","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0215","days":"MWF","time":"12","instructor":"RIMANYI,RICHARD","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QI"],"enrl_cap":120,"enrl_tot":120,"wait_cap":15,"wait_tot":3,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=324648","fname":"Richard","lname":"Rimanyi","quality":"4.0","easiness":"3.6","help":"3.6","clarity":"3.6","topTag":"","grade":"3.6","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["One of the very best professors in the math department (I'm a math major, trust me!). Very clear, good lecturing style. His tests are hard, but he grades fairly.","took honors section which was hard, though a good class when one can keep up with the material, often goes to fast and not easy to follow,","Rimanyi is a pretty good teacher, compared to some others at the math department.  He is extremely helpful and is willing to schedule additional office hours if necessary.  The book is very useful in this class and doing extra problems always helps.  As stated already, he does sometimes put questions from the book on the exam.","Very good teacher, fair grading, lectures are very clear.","Decent math teacher, if a stodgy one.  Test scores were low, but curve is generous.  If you totally butcher a test and do well later he's willing to diminish or drop the first exam.  Many of his exam problems were also in the textbook.. if that helps :-)."],"courses":["MATH578","MATH233H","MATH523","MATH547","MATH033"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
