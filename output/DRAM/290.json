Rambles a lots a in lecture and you watch videos which he will usually ask a couple questions on tests. Nice guy but don't take if you're looking for an easy A.","Went to office hours to look over a test and was given a 45 minute individual backstage tour of the playmakers theatre! Lectures can linger on but are much better (and helpful) if you actually do the reading when it's supposedly due.","Would not recommend this class. Babbles through lectures about information you won't be tested on. Picks random quotes from the plays and you have to identify who said it. NOT AN EASY A.","He uses the same questions from old tests except quotes are different. I never went to class and did completely fine. There are 2 papers but they are both outlined for you in the syllabus so they are pretty easy","I would definitely recommed this class.  All you have to do is read the plays and playwrights once (or twice if you really feel like it), and write 2 5-page papers.  The papers could have been graded better, but the tests (which were all mc) were easy!","Professor Cornell substituted for Professor Strong for Drama 116. He gave us a comprehensive study-guide for the final, so you didn't even have to attend class. AND he's super good looking!!!","Does everything he can to lure you into useless lectures. Babbles about plays whole class, none of the discussion is on test. Doesnt tell when he gives back poorly graded papers so you come to every stupid class. Does not tell you when exams are handed  either. must go 2 class to get answer keys and exams, puts nothing on line. Not recommended.","TA's grade papers... hard. Wrote an awesome paper discussing play I went and saw and gave me a B for my grammar. Lectures are OK, but tests have dumb questions and trivia such as dates, random quotes and overly picky items. I read plays and paid attention, should have been an easy A. However, Tests and papers were way too thorough and picky.","I went into this class thinking &quot;easy A.&quot; However, i was quickly proven wrong. Tests are MC but VERY picky. Asks random trivia from the text book and class sessions. His TA's grade essay's far too harshly. He gives 5 assignments, 2 essays, 3 exams--these are your only chance for grades, NO extra credit.On the upside, he is passionate about drama.","Yes his TA's grade papers, but I got a's both times. He is very enthusiastic and makes class interesting. The tests were easy all you have to do is read the plays. If you enjoy reading diff. plays about diff. cultural events and time periods you'll enjoy this class and he makes it very interesting. No homework besides reading","His TAs grade the papers really hard for stupid things, so this is pretty much a freshman english class--no joke. His lectures are completely boring, he just reads from the textbook which is overpriced, and he puts random trivia in exams that is sometimes not even mentioned in class. I do not recommend him.","No Comments","very interested in his topic and makes the subject more entertaining","Amazing!  He's so helpful if you go to his office hours.","He's an alright teacher.  Didn't show up to class much and still made a B.  Watch out for your papers, he grades HARD!","Super nice and fun. Love this man!","No Comments"],"courses":["DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM116","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA","DRAMA15","DRAMA50","DRAM15","DRAM50","DRAMA15","DRAMA","DRAM"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
