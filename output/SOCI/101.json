The real problem with the class is his lack of communication when it comes to assignments and the boring lectures. There are also few grading opportunities.  Participation is mandatory in the discussion session of the class, so get ready to talk or your grade will suffer.","Participating in the discussions matters a lot in your grade. I attended classes and paid attention, but I didn't raise my hand to participate. This screwed my grade over.","Here's the thing about Professor Perrin. He was respectful of different viewpoints, expected discussion, and gave interesting lectures. However, he grades based on the department standard of an average of B-. So you have to go above and beyond on assignments and tests by answering more than he asked for to get an A. But once you do, it's not hard.","Unless  you want to be a soci major, avoid at all costs.","Prof. Perrin is very passionate about what he does and he really understands college students. He brought his children to class on several occasions. He finds innovative ways to make material more applicable and memorable.","Avoid him at all costs. Awful and sarcastic about helping his students. Grades according to his opinion. His  open note tests are set up to make you fail","Though midterm&final were open booknote, grading was unfair. Doesn't like opinions that conflict with his&won't give any credit for them. Class is so boring, wanted to sleep through it each time. Gives grade based on participation, yet never writes down who speaks so must be an arbitrary number to him. Only few grades, so no room for mistakes.","Professor Perrin clearly has a passion for sociology, and does a pretty good job making it interesting.  However, the lectures can get pretty long and there are only about 4 important grades in the semester, so if you bomb one you're in trouble.","I had him for a FYS and he wasn't a good teacher. He strongly played favorites and was forceful with his opinions. If you disagreed with him, he would not show much respect for you. He didn't answer questions well and cut me off when I would ask them. He also graded unfairly and wouldn't justify grades I received when I talked to him. Bad guy.","Had this guy for a theory class, he didn't bother to do any teaching, making the students lecture. He would periodically interrupt to cut the presenter down and show how 'smart' he is. Overall kind of creepy, stay away!","The worst part about this class was that he had a mandatory discussion grade.  You are graded on how much to talk in class, which is ridiculous.  He was an ok teacher, very enthusiastic; however, the discussion part was hideous.","Professor Perrin is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  I had him for a FYS, and I have no doubt that it will always be at the top of the list of my favorite classes.  Lots of discussion; a little bit of reading; a lots of support and a friendly atmosphere."],"courses":["SOCI101","SOCI101","SOCI250","SOCI250","SOCI101","SOCI101","SOCIOLOGY101","SOCI101","SOCI50","SOCI111","SOCI250","SOCI050"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SOCI","catalog_nbr":101,"section":990,"class_nbr":11844,"title":"SOC PERSPECTIVES","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"TA","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":16,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
