Class essays are a little open ended so you can explore what ever topics are most interesting to you.  Brilliant woman and one of my favorite professors ever","took 206 and 102 with her. Great professor, interesting subject matter, and she really cares about your success as a student and a person","I couldn't love this professor any more! If you want to learn about Native American's this is the professor to take. She's a member of the Choctaw Nation, has worked at the BIA, and gives a unique perspective on the subject. I cannot suggest her more highly. I truly value the time I have spent in two of her classes. She has taught me so much.","Dr. Lambert is such a sweetheart. She is willing to talk to her students in and outside of the classroom. She is motivated to teach and willing to help her students anyway possible. Her grading is not too bad, but make sure to keep up with the readings. She is by far one of the best professors I've had at Carolina.","A wonderful and easy class if you are willing to do the reading. Reading of indigenous authors is the focus of the course and I have learned so much from the material and Prof Lambert (who  is just wonderful, encouraging, and very interested in the subject). She's one of my favorite Anthropology professors. Love her!!!","This class is very small and discussion based. The exams are written and graded easily.","This class was terrible.  I have never been so bored by a professor in my life. Professor Lambert takes what could be interesting information and sucks any type of fun out of it. Her class isn't too difficult but there is a lot of reading. I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone. Save yourself the boredom don't take this class. It's not worth it.","This teacher is horrible.  Her exams are based nothing on her lectures, which is nice if you plan on not attending class.  She makes you 400 page books but asks you only one multiple choice question on it.  This class is the biggest waste of time.  Mind you, the professor also lost my final exam so I had to take it over again.","SO BORING. I love Anthro, but this class was awful. Mandatory recitations. My TA was awful too, and sounded like she was going to cry whenever she talked. Easy class though. Lots of the readings are very interesting. If you read, the tests are unbelievably easy.","Lectures were incredibly boring. TAs do all of the grading for only 3 tests (90% of your grade) and 10% of a participation grade. Go to recitation to figure out what you really need to know for the tests, otherwise, skip the lecture unless you want another hour of sleep.","I am an Anth major, and this class almost turned me off to the field as a freshman. Skip it and take something more interesting in the department. She speaks clearly but VERY slowly. She says &quot;we&quot; whenever speaking about a certain NA tribe, which comes off as pretentious. Overall, a very nice, smart woman who will give you any help you need.","This seemed like a very easy class. I had an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;A-&quot; throughout the course, but when I got my final grade, it was a &quot;B+.&quot; I still have not been able to get in touch with the TA to figure out why/how I got the grade I did. EXTREMELY boring, though. If you take Benadryl for allergies, you will NOT stay awake; believe me, I tried.","Easy class, sometimes gets extremely boring! A little too much reading, but you might be able to go around and still get a B, but over all an easy A class.","Lecture is incredibly boring...easy exams...review the readings right before exam.","Easy class, lectures can drag on, and the tests are easy.  The reading is essential and can be long, though this is an easy anthropology class overall.  I did well, even though I have no love for anthropology.","This class was easy and the subject material is very interesting.  Lectures can be boring at times but overall it's a great class.","easy class. can get boring but not bad for a gen ed requirement. no recitation which is nice. much much easier and less work than other anthro ged ed classes. good teacher, not many assignments. 2nd midterm and final were take home."],"courses":["ANTH406","ANTH206","206","ANTH206","ANTH406","ANTH406","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH102","ANTH130","ANTH130"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
