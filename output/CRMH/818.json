Take her!","Radha is a very sweet professor, and her lectures are very clear. Her exams are multiple choice and not curved, but a curve is not necessary. The average grade for the first exam was a 92.5. She has random class exercises (once every couple weeks on average) instead of taking attendance. I enjoyed her class and her teaching style."],"courses":["PSYC245","PSYC245"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
