She's very unorganized and kind of rude, just seems like she doesn't care. Would not recommend.","Excellent readings but not much interest in teaching.  Does some interesting work as an artist, but doesn't seem very interested in teaching.  My guess is she's brilliant, loves art and hates her job.  Pity for students (and for her).","She is the least helpful and most unorganized prof. I  have ever had at college--avoid her at all costs."],"courses":["COMM249","COMM249","COMM639"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","POOR"]}}]
