Makes learning Portuguese interesting by telling funny jokes or teaching you Brazilian street slang. Very laid back and always fun to joke around with. Tests are easy and he prepares you well on what to study. One of my favorite professors at UNC.","Professor Vernon is a genuinely nice and relaxed guy, makes learning Portuguese really interesting and certainly thinks outside of the box.","Awesome Professor. I hate taking language classes but I loved his class mostly just because of him. Every day he will make you laugh and is never in a bad mood. Loves to work with his class and is definitely my favorite professor at UNC. Would highly recommend but be prepared to study a fair amount for tests.","Very great 101 professor. He always answered questions. Very laid back. I am grateful for having him as a 101 because I feel as if i learned a lot more from him than from other teachers I heard about. His tests were easy and online assignments weren't checked until the tests. Always looked forward to his class!","Great guy, really funny. You'll learn a lot besides Portuguese from him too.","Great professor, awesome guy, great class. Learned a ton and always looked forward to class!","Very cool, laid back character.  Class tends to be a bit unstructured, but he prepares you well enough for tests.  Vernon is a very approachable guy; he'll answer whatever questions you have to the best of his ability.  One fault: it takes him a while to return tests and compositions.  But he's a fun lecturer so it's a wash.","Great class, great guy! Very funny, made me look forward to this class! Learned a lot too!","Professor Vernon was great and provided interesting comments.  I was afraid of this class before taking it but thankfully he grades fairly and does not provide too much, or too little work.","He is a great guy and the material is interesting if you are a language buff, but he is a bit scatter-brained at times and the class was highly unorganized at first.  Also, it is uspposed to be Brazilian Portuguese but he usually speaks with a Portuguese accent.  Nothing too bad against him, though.","Mr. Vernon is a great teacher.  The class is mainly just reading short stories and then you have daily quizzes on what you read.  The quizzes aren't hard if you do the reading.  The midterms are graded very lentiently.  Overall a very fun class that isn't too difficult and the professor is very funny and not boring at all.","Very nice guy, class material isn't that interesting, but not terrible... recommend knowing some stuff about business first though","Great professors. Exams were very easy and he was always willing to give half credit if you got something wrong but at least knew part it. Would definantly recommend him","A pretty easy, laid back class..a few midterms, which he grades leniently, two short 1-page papers and daily quizzes on the readings. If you're looking for something fun and easy to fulfill that Fine Arts Literature perspective, this is the class."],"courses":["PORT203","PORT101","PORT101","PORT101","PORT203","PORT401","SPAN204","PORT401","SPAN260","PORT401","PORT035","SPAN25","SPAN025","PORT35"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PORT","catalog_nbr":203,"section":1,"class_nbr":2592,"title":"INTERMED PORT I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0210","days":"MWF","time":"09","instructor":"GOMEZ,LUIS M","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["FL"],"enrl_cap":19,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":3,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=495221","fname":"Luis Marcelino","lname":"Gomez","quality":"4.5","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Respected (2)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["HILARIOUS","RESPECTED","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["He's by far my favorite professor at UNC! He is hilarious and really cares about his students. Just make sure to do your homework and participate in class! He makes it easy to participate, and is incredibly helpful, so don't be afraid if you say the wrong answer. He will give you the grade you deserve, but he is a wonderful teacher!","Professor Gomez planned each class well, and his powerpoints were both informational and HILARIOUS. His class was always entertaining, and he really cares about his students. If you want to learn a language at all, he will care about your learning and help you succeed. Definitely the most I've ever learned of a language in one semester.","LOVE HIM. very tough, but it's hard not to like him. Spanish 260 was my favorite class, because it was actually interactive. He got us to participate daily. If you do the readings and study all the time, it won't be too bad. Expect pop quizzes and he's also a harsh grader!","THE BEST PROFESSOR I have ever had. He is a kind and caring professor, a joy to talk to, makes hilariously entertaining and yet educational powerpoints. Do everything you can to take a class with him. He is fantastic.","El profesor Gómez is an understanding, passionate, and funny teacher. Speaking classes are always uncomfortable when you're learning, but he was incredibly helpful during office hours. Anyone who refers to his class as \"my dear students\" and means it clearly cares. Show him you do as well and you're golden.","Gomez is quite possibly the greatest professor you will ever have. He doesn't give out grades that you don't deserve but he cares so much about the material and his students and is hilarious. He's the sweetest man and calls his class \"my dear students\". If you work hard, participate and study you will do well. Go to his office hours!!","Professor Gómez is a fantastic teacher. He makes an effort to get to know all of his students and get them excited about learning Spanish. He's studied pretty much everything so if you have a question, he has the answer. Not the easiest professor, but certainly very rewarding.","A great guy, really interesting and really loves his students.  However, he does not make the class easy and 99% of the learning has to be done at home, out of the book, which sucks.  If you can easily learn Spanish on your own I would definitely recommend taking him over someone else but if you generally have a hard time I would reconsider SPAN204","Prof. Gomez clearly loves his job. He is very interesting and funny and makes classes easy to enjoy. He's a really wonderful professor.","Really nice guy!!! Go talk to him after class!!! He has some interesting stories to tell!!!! However,  he teaches way too much out of the book and I didn't learn much of anything in his class.  The book was really bad so the class was often boring.  Gomez is a great guy though.  Really cares about his students!","Best teacher ever, very funny and kind. The class is not hard at all and he grades easily on papers.","He is a great teacher who loves teaching Spanish.  He is probably the best professor I have had at UNC.  Definitely take his class if you have the chance - you will not regret it.  He keeps things funny during class and is very laid back during class.","He's a sweet man who cares about teaching a lot. He's very non-threatening which makes it easy to worry less about mistakes. I've had nothing but good professor in this department, but he was by far the best.","AMAZING! one of the best spanish  professors I've had so far - he's extremely enthusiastic and his little Powerpoints are wonderful - and sometimes humorous. fun class - just participate, don't worry about messing up. He's not intimidating at all and will help you with whatever you need.","He was an amazing professor! He was so interested in his subject and his powerpoints were a little slice of heaven! (If you have him you'll see what I mean)Maybe the best professor I've ever had in Spanish and maybe even school period.","Fantastic professor. I had a great experience and plan on taking more classes with him in the future.","Very energetic about teaching.  Really want students to succed and will work with them in this regard.","He wants to be a poet... and turns out he is one. Do not get wrapped up in the philosophical stuff. Ohh yea... pretend you really care about Spanish and he will seriously LOVE you. Love = A","No Comments","an awesome spanish teacher--willing to work with you and presents material in an understandable manner. classwork isn't necessarily easy, but its fun and he's a good teacher"],"courses":["PORT101","PORT101","SPAN260","SPAN255","SPAN255","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN4","SPANISH4","SPAN4"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
