His classes, even his introductory ones, are not easy. You gotta put in the work, especially on exams and written work. Like bones? Take him.","Pay attention in class, he has questions on the test about his 20 second off-handed remarks. Expects you to remember everything. Gives study guides, then the test is on different content. The tests have TRICK QUESTIONS. He focuses too much on minute details and name-dropping. Pure rote memorization, doesn't give a bigger understanding of the world.","Anth 50 was interesting and boring all at the same time. I liked the forensics topics, but I wasn't in to the bioarcheology topics at all. The lectures were dry, but the group projects were fun. However, the fun projects weren't worth a semester of boring lectures and reading assignments. Dale is a good teacher, but the just class wasn't for me.","Professor Hutchinson clearly loves his field of study and is very knowledgeable about human origins, but he had a difficult time conveying the information in a helpful way. His powerpoints were very disorganized, and sometimes the information was out of date or did not align with what was in the textbook. I wish there had been more consistency.","Fantastic professor! I took his ANTH 50 class and it was the most enjoyable course I took all semester. His lectures are engaging and always interesting. Not to mention we handled real skeletons! The readings are interesting as well, and are very good books.","416 involves 3 group projects, 1 case study paper, and a final exam, all which are decently graded if done correctly. Also, final exam is given to you and you may bring a 2 page cheat sheet. It definitely comes in handy being familiar with anatomical terms before this course. Interesting course about diseases, the dead, and archaeology","The 3 exams involve a lot of memorization, and reading the novel and textbook is essential in order to do well. Lectures are often confusing, but the textbook may clarify the lecture concepts. There is also a paper, and its requirements are clearly outlined with examples. There are lecture & recitation attendance grades, so always attend class!","I had him as a professor my first semester at UNC and found it very difficult to do well in his class (as compared to all of my other classes). He is very vague during lecture and provides a lot of material without really explaining its relevance. If you do not read the textbook, you will not pass.","lectures were very confusing and i learned everything from the textbook. the exams are all multiple choice consisting of memorization.","This is the most interesting class I have taken in college. Dale looks a lot like an archaeologist and he fits the position perfectly. Tests were difficult for me as a math major: pure memorization and LOTS of it. The average on the midterm was a C-, but the final was easier and he added bonus questions. This class was a lot of work but worth it.","Definitely looks like an anthropologist. This class was hard, a lot of memorizing material to be honest. The field is constantly changing so the material actually changed a little while learning it. Look in the text book for the stuff you don't understand and ask the TAs. Not an easy A, and attendance is mandatory, but it wasn't the worst class.","His class was overall very interesting! At times the course material could get a little boring but he adds in stories and experiences to  liven it up. All you really have to do to get a good grade are go to class and study some for the exams!","Super engaging and enthusiastic professor who, imo, makes lectures very interesting. Tests are all multiple choice, matching, and true/false, which isn't too difficult. You'll watch a lot of film. *Note: He assigns readings in the textbooks for every class, but you never actually use it in class, and only have one paper related to them.","If you don't mind memorizing long lists of fossils, their location, the researchers who found them, the time it was discovered, what soil it was in, etc, etc, etc, then take this class. It really was just tedious memorization, which of course I soon forgot. Hutchinson is nice, but it doesn't make up for the class on the whole.","Best professor ive had so far. very clear, willing to give multiple definitions, examples are very good and help you understand more complex topics, and he looks the part! if u want to take anth take it with him","He's really interesting in the topic, but the material is confusing. There are no hard facts, but the tests are all multiple choice, which makes things confusing. I got two C- on my midterms and still managed to pull out an 88 in the class. He weighs attendance as much as exams so GO TO CLASS!","Most interesting class I've taken at UNC. Professor Hutchinson is extremely approachable and willing to give you all the help you need to understand the material.","Dr. Hutchinson is really excited and enthusiastic about teaching biological anthropology and is extremely helpful if clarification is needed. Although the subject matter can get a little dry at times, he was a pretty engaging teacher and we watched a lot of film. If you go to class and read, you will get a good grade.","This class was horrendously boring. Hutchinson just shuffled around and talked in a monotone voice about fossils without really discussing the relevance of what we were learning. Just a lot of memorization and redundancy.","It's been a few years but Dale was amazing.  I had him for 2 classes in the same semester and it was both the most challenging and the best semester I had at UNC.  Very approachable and highly interested in his students."],"courses":["ANTH50","ANTH148","ANTH50","ANTH148","ANTH50","ANTH416","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH123","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTHR147","ANTH414","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH414"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ANTH","catalog_nbr":414,"section":6,"class_nbr":7010,"title":"HUMAN OSTEOLOGY LAB","component":"Lab","units":1,"bldg":"Alumni","room":"0404","days":"MWF","time":"13","instructor":"HUTCHINSON,DALE L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":16,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=70023","fname":"Dale","lname":"Hutchinson","quality":"3.5","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Get ready to read (4)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["RESPECTED","GET READY TO READ","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES","GET READY TO READ","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","GET READY TO READ","SKIP CLASS?
