It is nice to have a professor who truly knows so much on one topic. Record his lectures and read the book and you should be fine! Recitation is easy it is just 3-5 hw problems from the book per week... not bad at all! Take him for 205!","The class is awsome. Jones is terrific.  If you are not a serious student, then don't bother because you'll just complain like some of these other babies are doing who marked this class poor.If you are serious- this is a must-take class.","I have terrible memories of his class.","This professor is belittling and is not approachable for help or guidance. This professor is knowledgeable and his lectures are understandable. His tests are very tricky multiple choice. The tests do not represent the material covered in lectures. If you have an opportunity to take another professor, then do. He is not recommended.","The test were hard as****, and the recitations were not easy either","extremely excited about the course, is clear and fair. wants students to do well but the course is pretty difficult as a whole.","Terrible teacher, incredibly hard, good luck staying awake","very clear-  the course is a must for those interested in cells- he does a great job covering a lot about cells in just 7 weeks.exams are tough but he trys to be fair","He loves cell biology and he really seems like he wants us to understand how it is important in our lives. Very helpful and fair but firm with the class policy. The book material is important so don't blow it off. Forget about the recitations though. I didn't like cell biology before but am very interested now."],"courses":["205","BIOL205","BIO52","BIO205","BIOL205","BIO205","BIOL205","BIOL52","BIOL52"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
