She cares so much about her students, and even though she expects you to learn a lot on your own, she's still willing to help you out. She takes her time to read your papers and she's really into Physics, too! 10/10.","I strongly dislike Prof. Mack and she most definitely dislikes me. She's very unclear about everything, assigns busy work, which is the bane of my existence, talks about culture all day but does grammar heavy tests and will not let you make up graded in class activities if you miss, even if you have a note. Am personally never taking ever again.","One of the best and nicest professors I've had at UNC. She mostly speaks in Spanish, but will use English if you really need it. Classes were usually pretty energetic and helpful. Tests were generally pretty easy. Participation hinges on both class activities and an oral presentation with a partner.","Good teacher, great person. Really enjoyed being in her class. Span 203 was very easy for me and the workload was fairly light. I definitely recommend taking her class. Nicest professor I've had so far. Do the msl assignments ahead of time and remember when the Letras quizzes are.","She is just so incredibly disorganized and changes her mind so often it's not even funny. I did well in the class, but I just spent a lot of time frustrated at her. She's also really biased when she grades, so you better agree with her opinion. She is just so frustrating. No, just no.","She really cares about her students and has them do lots of group projects to promote collaboration.  There's homework almost every class, but it's not a lot.  Tests are from readings of stories and vocab words.  She's off topic a lot, or just talks.","She is a really nice lady, but I didn't like her as a teacher.  She is a native of Puerto Rico, and she has several language and linguistics degrees.  This course was a culture course.  She assigned large amounts of reading or group presentations the night before.  We didn't have a text book so she would find research studies and email them to us.","Unorganized, changes her mind.  Comes across as nice and fun.  Made classmates cry.  Waste of my time at UNC.","This was very unstructured and unorganized. Assignments were random and never clearly explained. The class seemed very interesting at first but was not what I expected."],"courses":["SPAN326","SPAN300","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN300","SPAN266","SPAN335","ROML052","ROML052"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
