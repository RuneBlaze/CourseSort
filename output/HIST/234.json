Often tells random jokes or funny thoughts in class, and once she starts laughing it's hard for her to stop.","Professor Tone-Pah-Hote is excellent. She facilitates discussion well and encourages everyone to participate. Doing all the reading is a must - she wants to see reflection and analysis in your papers. She did a wonderful job of making the class interactive and fun.","Dr. Tone-Pah-Hote is probably one of the most caring and loving professors I know. She grades harshly, but if you do the work and partcipate, you'll be fine. She is so funny and tells the most random jokes, ever.","Professor Tone-Pah-Hote is the best! Totally passionate about her work and the subject she teaches. You will notice quickly that public speaking may not be her forte, but that didn't make anyone doubt her ability to teach a class. Class involves writing multiple short 3-4 page papers and a long 6-8 page paper, but it's manageable.
