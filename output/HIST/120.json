Would definitely take again!","Professor Andrews is honestly my favorite professor at UNC. He clearly outlines what is expected in the syllabus. You have three papers and an essay final- all graded by TA's. However, if you make an effort and go to the TA's office hours you should be fine. Andrews is a fantastic lecturer and I will definitely be taking another one of his courses!","Dr. Andrews is THE BEST professor at UNC! If you don't take at least one of his classes you are wasting your tuition!","Awesome lectures, fun person! Its a great class, 3 papers and then the final. Also short (and easy) quizzes in recitations, which do not happen every week.  The TA's grade everything so I guess your grade depends on them more then him. But they all seam to not grade really hard. Deff would recommend 110%","Professor Andrews is the best professor I have ever had. His lectures were so inspirational and interesting that I am now considering a history minor. We had three papers, some reading for homework, and a final; not bad at all. This class was the highlight of my semester. Oh, and he is super hot too, which makes lecture even better.","Dr. Andrews is one the best teachers/ professors I have ever had. You will no doubt enjoy the class (his lectures are always awesome) even if the material doesn't seem that interesting to you. The best class I've taken at UNC and the most fun I've had listening to a lecture. If you can take a class w/ Dr. Andrews, TAKE IT!!","Dr. Andrews is THE best lecturer at UNC, hands down. However, all essays are graded by TA's, which is always subjective. His class was definitely the highlight of my semester though, and I'll definitely be taking another of his classes. Genuinely great guy","He's a good guy and his lectures are interesting, but your grade completely depends on what TA you get so good luck there.","I think the other reviews sum up Matt Andrew's classes pretty well. His lectures are absolutely phenomenal, he's a down to earth guy who is willing to help if you need it, and his class is super interesting. The TAs grade everything which was sort of hit or miss.","Dr. Andrews is a fantastic professor and made my first semester at UNC a much more positive experience. His lectures are well-planned, clear, and he stops and pauses multiple times to get questions/comments from the class. I decided to minor in history because of this class (128). If you get the chance, definitely take any of his classes.","Dr. Andrews is honestly the best professor I have had at UNC. His lectures are so interesting that I don't even feel the time pass. Even though the class is huge, he encourages participation and questions. He is also super helpful during office hours. I would highly recommend that you take his class before you leave UNC!","I LOVED Professor Andrews. He is the best professor I've had at UNC and an amazing person. Plus, he's not that bad to look at during class. He's super personable and dreamy.","He's awesome, engaging, and funny. The class was interesting and fairly easy!","THE BEST professor I have ever had.  His lectures are engaging and it is always easy to pay attention.","Andrews is by far my favorite professor at UNC. His class is well structured and his lectures have an easy to follow outline. He assigns an average amount of reading for a History course, but all the reading is super interesting. Will take again for sure!","This is the second class I have taken with him. He is a great lecturer, and keeps it interesting. However, all of the grading is up to the TAs, and they can be VERY tough graders. He is a great guy, but don't expect great grades.  I didn't use the textbook.","By far the best lecturer at UNC. I would take any class with him.","The TAs did all the grading (2 papers, recitation, final) but Andrews' lecture were awesome.
