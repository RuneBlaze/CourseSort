Yes, he will &quot;single you out,&quot; but it's all in fun - just the fact that it comes out of the blue and suddenly he's leaning over you and grinning can be a little startling. I highly recommended this professor.","I'm really not sure why people don't seem to like Prof Anderson on here. He's enthusiastic and clear about what he's teaching, clearly loves the material himself, and makes himself available for help outside of class. I definitely wouldn't say he puts research ahead of teaching. Everyone in our class really seemed to enjoy having him.","His is incredibly obnoxious. Rude. Will single you out in front of the class, put you on the spot, and ridicule you. I am a talented musician, and his class is making me want to drop the music major. He'e eccentric, makes zero sense, and very boring. His class was the longest hour and a half of my week.","So much love. We all enjoyed his class, and he definitely puts in time to prepare for teaching (sometimes writing his own pieces to teach us how things work). Highly recommend.","He's a pretty funny guy and his tests are super easy. He isn't too helpful out of class, though (nor too friendly). But tests are a very easy (lots of As). There's no reason NOT to get an A. Plus, the subject gets increasingly interesting over time. OVerall, good teacher.","This man is an eccentric horses ass.  He knows music but gives exactly 2****s about his students. This is the type of professor that only cares about notoriety and being published.","No Comments","No Comments","This is a music majors-only course.  Prof. Anderson really knows chromatic harmony.  Because he is also a composition teacher, it comes naturally to him to teach us how to use theoretical concepts in real writing.  We wrote a minuet and performed them!"],"courses":["MUSC232","MUSC232","MUSC132","MUSC232H","MUSC145","MUSTHE","MUSC037","MUSC037","MUSC037"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
