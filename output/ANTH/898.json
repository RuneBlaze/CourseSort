Learned a lot about global health and social factors. Class consisted of 2 group projects, 2 case studies, midterm and final. Projects were completed during recitation so that's a plus. Midterm and final aren't bad if you study but demanding in the time given.","The grading in the class is often confusing and varies greatly based off which TA grades your paper/exam, but lecture was always very interesting and the material was engaging. We got to watch several cool videos in class, and the readings aren't particularly necessary in order to get a good grade in the class. She did do attendance checks."],"courses":["ANTH319","ANTH318"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
