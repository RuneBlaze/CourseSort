The lectures are not the most riveting in the world but Dr. Johnson does assign some really thought provoking readings about globalization. It's possible to miss class and do alright on the mid-termfinal as long as you follow the key words. Worth the take!","This is a fairly easy class, though coming to lecture and reading are important. There is a lot of reading and some writing (8 journal entries and a 10 page policy paper), but overall not too bad. Recitation is super helpful. Midterms and finals are just identifying terms (given beforehand) and an essay. Class is sometimes unclear and vague.","Professor Johnson shows little regard for her students or the subject matter and instead focuses the majority of the course on presenting the most subjective view of the material possible. If you enjoy thinking for yourself and analyzingevaluating policies from both sides in order to draw your own conclusions steer clear of this class at all costs","She is a nice lady and I get the impression that she wishes the class was smaller so that we could all get to know her. She is passionate and knows her stuff. Lots of information in lecture but its clear cut and easy to take notes on. If you pay attention in lecture you're set for the exams.","Very easy if you get a good TA","Dr. Johnson is interesting to listen to. The class is not difficult if you do the work. Expectations are very clear and assignments are manageable. Dr. Johnson is readily available for questions and clarification. Would take another class with her!","The grades have absolutely nothing to do with Dr. Johnson.  The TAs do EVERYTHING. Honestly, if you dont have a good TA you should drop switch sections or try again next semester."],"courses":["GLBL210","GLBL210","GLBL210","GLBL210","GLBL210","GLBL210","GLBL210"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
