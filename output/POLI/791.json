The class was strategy and politics. I wasn't all that interested in the class at first, but she turned out to be a great lecturer. Has an accent, but she uses powerpoint to make her points more clear. Tests are extremely easy. Assignments were much harder but they counted less. Highly recommended if you are interested in game theory."],"courses":["POLI195"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
