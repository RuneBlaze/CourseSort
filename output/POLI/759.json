He's incredibly smart, passionate about international conflict, and cares about his students. He made me love game theory and international conflict. And, he is more than willing to provide assistance when material is confusing. I'd take anything he taught.","Not the most exciting lecturer, but he is very nice and helpful. He uses powerpoints but doesn't put notes on them. So you have to listen up in lecture. Exams and papers were reasonable. Be sure to take advantage of office hours. There is a lot of information to absorb in this class.","This was one of my favorite classes at UNC. His lectures were interesting and he's a funny guy. Tests are based on the recitation readings and his lectures, not so much on the textbooks. If you go to class and do the reading you'll do fine.","Does a good job in lecture of making the material interesting.  Attendance is very slack for lecture, but it helps to attend.  Tests require lots of detail but aren't overly difficult.  If you get a good TA, you're in good shape.  Class average is about a low B.","Lectures were interesting most of the time. Lots of reading. Tests were kind of tough but not impossible plus he curved. I would definitely take it again.","great professor, knows how to teach. class was on the difficult side. tests were tough, a combination of tricky MC and short answers with a longer essay. tough grader, and he enjoys it. i would recommend it, I think everyone should get some sense of international politics","Only gives about 12% A/A-, which is worse than intro chem classes.His tests were essentially a collection of the most trivial things he could think of.His goal is to think up MC questions that have never been used before anywhere, so they end up being tricky and nit-picky.His lectures are interesting enough and he's a nice guy, but avoid his class.","No Comments","Tests are pretty difficult, and he doesn't seem too interested in making them better.  His lectures are OK, but his tests ruin the course.  Avoid him.","interesting class. HARD tests. lots of reading. curves pretty well (altough he has too, av. on the firts test was a 60) be prepared to work very hard to get a good grade, but A's are feasible.","Well...if you love multiple choice tests that are tricky then do take his class. There is a lot of reading with this course. Other than textbooks there are many articles to read and you are tested on them. Recitation also requires additional reading which you are tested on. The class was not inspiring.","Interesting class...hard tests","No Comments"],"courses":["POLI150H","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLIPWAD86"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
