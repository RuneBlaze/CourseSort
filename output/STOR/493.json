Had to google most things for my homework, didn't buy the textbook nor did I need it. Doesn't take attendance so don't need to go to class. Not a stimulating class, not an easy class. He's a cool guy, but not a good professor","Tests are very tricky.  I thought I did really well on the final until I saw I got a C because he recycles old midterm problems, but slightly changes the wording so don't expect it to be the same answer. My advice would be to write out all of your homework and save it when studying for tests. He replaced our lowest midterm with our final exam grade","Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend","A very good professor. He cares about the students, he is fair, he presents the material in a clear way. Absolutely recommended!","Take it with some one else. He is a nice guy, but over-complicates topics that should be easy to understand. Awful at explaining the material. If you don't have an innate knack for stats, this class will make your situation even worse.","Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.","He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.","He's a really nice, generous and helpful guy. Makes the occasional joke in class. Goes through material somewhat quickly and isn't always clear in answering questions. Review session before final hurt more than it helped. Overall a good class and a great guy.","Most examples are from text. Test questions based on homework and notes.

One 4 problem homework assignment a week.  You don't have to go to class because his lectures are straight from the textbook, but I still found it helpful to attend his lectures.  You don't even have to show up to turn in homework, you can just leave it in his office.  Super chill guy, easy material.","Professor Ziya teaches straight from the textbook, and he assigns little homework. 90% of your grade is from the two midterms and the final, so you have to prepare well for your exams! He curves at the end. He's very nice and will help if you ask BUT you have to put in the effort to ask. Lectures do seem long, but overall he's a decent professor!","Professor Ziya is such a nice guy! His lectures can be a little boring and very long, but he will do anything to make sure you understand the material, and he is very accommodating. I had to register during one of our exams, so he let me take the exam at a different time! Such a nice guy!","Contents of lectures are exactly the same as those on the textbook. No help on doing homework or exams."],"courses":["STOR151","STOR151","STOR151","STOR641"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"STOR","catalog_nbr":493,"section":29,"class_nbr":9322,"title":"INTERNSHIP IN STOR","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"Cunningham,Robin Joseph","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1871221","fname":"Robin","lname":"Cunningham","quality":"4.7","easiness":"2.4","help":"2.4","clarity":"2.4","topTag":"Respected (10)","grade":"2.4","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["HILARIOUS","EXTRA CREDIT","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","CARING","RESPECTED","TOUGH GRADER","RESPECTED","HILARIOUS","HILARIOUS","RESPECTED","HILARIOUS","RESPECTED","CARING","HILARIOUS","CARING","RESPECTED","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","CARING"],"comments":["I LOVE Cunningham, but I didn't do as well in his class as I thought I should have. His final had some tricky questions on it, but I enjoyed his cheesy jokes so much that I'd do it all over again","Cunningham is such an amazing teacher, I honestly never minded being in his class. He is a very fair teacher and will curve tests/drop questions if he feels that they are too hard. If you don't do too well on a midterm but do better on a final, that grade will be replaced as well. Would recommend any STOR class taught by him","Robin is amazing, smart, funny, helpful and down to earth. This is one of the easier STATS classes because there's no calculus needed but you still have to study and watch out for little tricks in tests. There was homework every class but it wasn't crazy hard and he always reopened it. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS ITS WITH HIM!! I love this man!","Cunningham is by far one of the best professors at UNC. The material is hard but I always look forward to class- he is full of jokes. He always has long office hours and review sessions before the exams(highly recommended). TAKE THIS CLASS. He is beyond helpful and his love for math shows.","One of the best professors I've had at UNC. He's a must-have for either STOR 155 or 215. He's funny, friendly, and overall just a great guy. If he makes his test too hard, he has no issue curving the class so that the grade distribution is better.","He's adorable. Little bit of a stutter, but if you don't mind that he's literally the best STOR 155 professor at UNC.","Professor Cunningham makes his class enjoyable. He's really good at explaining concepts and this is coming from someone who had no experience with statistics. Show up to class and you'll be able to catch on to the material pretty quickly.","Prof Cunningham is awesome - very clear, but be ready to be fast-paced. He will fly through lessons, but you'll understand everything that's going on. Take the class!!","FAVORITE PROF EVER. Class was always filled with laughter. Such a goodnatured guy. Cares about students doing well. If I could take this class again I would. Makes the material comprehensible even for students who have had a hard time with other math classes. Love love love him","I absolutely loves Prof. Cunningham. His love for stats shows when he teaches and he makes it easy and fun with his teaching methods and occasional jokes.  Definitely has the interest of students' grades at heart. First exam score is high, second is tricky because of probability. Visit him in office hours--he loves to learn about his students","Funny, cool guy. Recommended","Dr. Cunningham does a great job of making sure that everyone in STOR 113 understands the material that is being discussed.  Homework can be tricky, but it is definitely doable and he does his best to prepare your for his tests.  If you need to take a math class, definitely consider Dr. Cunningham's STOR 113.  Solid pace for the course content.","If you've taken calc before, it's relatively simple. However, if you haven't taken calc beforehand, you may struggle, the class moves pretty quickly. If you show up, do the homework, and make an effort to understand the concepts, you'll do well. Dr. Cunningham is a really good teacher, and provides ample help when needed.","Dr. Cunningham is a great guy who obviously has a passion for what he teaches. He grades very fairly, and help is always there if you need it. Highly recommended.","I had this class early in the morning, but Professor Cunningham's enthusiasm, jokes, and overall laid-back (yet focused) attitude made it a great class to wake up for. He makes a real effort to answer all questions and work out all types of problems on the board, and was really good about going over homework. Tests were a little tricky!","He is an awesome guy and a clear teacher! One warning: if you did not take calc before this class, consider it. I found it very challenging without a calc background and the class moves very quickly with around 60% of the students already having taken calc. Its possible just tons more work for people without calc background.","He's honestly the best professor I've had here. If you get the change to take him, you have to do it. He goes over the homework before you turn it in and really cares if the class understands the material. Takes a true interest in his students. An all around great guy and professor. Most definitely recommend taking him!","Dr. Cunningham makes an effort to make his class more interesting. I took Stor 151 and it was pretty much an easy A. There was homework before every class, but it was pretty simple and he goes over it before you hand it in. Tests are pretty easy and he goes over all of the material in class.","He's awesome and incredibly personable. Definitely worth taking!","Dr. Cunningham is by far one of the best teachers I've had ever. He is a down-to-earth guy and genuinely cares if you're doing well. He makes it a goal to memorize his students names and get to know them. Not everyone gets A's, but his goal is to have B averages on all exams bc he wants you to do well. BY ALL MEANS, take one of his classes!"],"courses":["STOR155","STOR215","STOR155","STOR155","STOR215","STOR155","STOR155","STOR155","STOR151","STOR155","STOR151","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR151","STOR113","STOR113"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
