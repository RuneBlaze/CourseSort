I thought I did really well on the final until I saw I got a C because he recycles old midterm problems, but slightly changes the wording so don't expect it to be the same answer. My advice would be to write out all of your homework and save it when studying for tests. He replaced our lowest midterm with our final exam grade","Overcomplicates all of the topics, going to class hurts more than it helps. He burns through the material, and the review sessions and practice midterms had nothing to do with the actual test. Gives lots of notes and examples in class, but uses totally different ones on the homework. Would not recommend","A very good professor. He cares about the students, he is fair, he presents the material in a clear way. Absolutely recommended!","Take it with some one else. He is a nice guy, but over-complicates topics that should be easy to understand. Awful at explaining the material. If you don't have an innate knack for stats, this class will make your situation even worse.","Very difficult class.  Didn't help that he burned through the material.  Nice guy though.  Knew what he was doing.","He goes through the material very quickly. Class was relatively pointless except to turn in homework (which is graded!) Review sessions were pointless, and the previous exams he posts are nothing like the exams he gave my class. He is a nice enough guy, but you have to ask specific questions if you expect any help from him.","He's a really nice, generous and helpful guy. Makes the occasional joke in class. Goes through material somewhat quickly and isn't always clear in answering questions. Review session before final hurt more than it helped.
