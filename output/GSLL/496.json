She's very helpful and I'd recommend any of her classes highly. There is quite a bit of homework, but it's not unmanageable.","Awesome professor! Great class! Wish I could take it over just for fun. :)A few pop quizzes that are only hard if you don't do the homework.","A really cool german teacher.  She is german of course, and is really friendly.  There is quite a bit of HW for 301, but its easy, jsut time consuming.  I recommend the class a lot.

Lapushin is the bomb. Super easy grader and fantastic, interesting lectures. If you ever get the chance to take a class with him DO IT. One of the best professors at UNC.","Hands-down, one of the best professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I took one class with him my third semester at Carolina and took another my fourth and fifth semesters here! He inspired me to change my major to Russian and Slavic Language and Culture and has been there to guide me every step of the way! Take a class with him!","I had Lapushin for a first year seminar, Madness and (Russian) Lit. Class is almost entirely discussion-based with only a little bit of highly informal lecture. By the end of the semester I was wishing he would lecture more because he is SO GOOD at it--he is engaging and inspiring. Also, he's very easy at least in a FYS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","Really passionate about the subject. Helpful, enthusiastic, and engaging. Take his class!","Awesome prof - dedicated, enthusiastic, very russian :) class was a joy","The best professor at UNC.","So enthusiastic and entertaining! Lots of reading, but he never gives reading quizzes. Not the easiest paper grader, but not too difficult and he offers help","Professor Lapushin is the hidden jem of UNC. He is the best professor I've ever had. His passion and excitement for what he teaches makes every class worth attending just so you can hear him talk. Sometimes he'll act out scenes from what we're reading and drop to his knees. He is super nice and really wants his students to do well. Take his classes","Read the other reviews. Lapushin is the best professor at UNC, bar none. He sometimes has a habit of talking over students, but only because he gets so excited over books. He's like one of those professors from movies that ends up changing your perspective on the world. Take a class with this man before you graduate. And UNC: tenure this man!","Easily one of the best professors I have had at UNC.  I'm a math major, but after taking a russian literature class from Professor Lapushin, I have a genuine interest in the subject.  Lapushin makes virtually every reading fascinating.  He is also an incredibly nice and helpful person.","Great professor.  His passion for books and reading is infectious.  He helps you to see and understand literature in completely new ways.  He's also genuinely a nice person and concerned with every student's performance in the class.  Take him!","The best professor I've ever had.","Simply put, he is the man.","Absolutely phenomenal professor.  I don't care what your major is, don't leave Carolina without taking a course with this man.  He is brilliant, helpful, and extremely funny.  Russian literature comes to life when he's at the helm.  In fact, just let Lapushin teach everything.","I LOVE THIS MAN! he is funny, very passionate, and really makes us get down to the bottom of the question during class discussions. always pushes us to understand the text better. there are only two papers and two exams, the rest is reading and discussion. oh, and prepare for the best Russian accent you will ever hear.","One of the funniest and intelligent professors ever.  He truly knows exactly what he's talking about and is ALWAYS available to help out if you feel you need it at all.

Definitely not a good class to take for your PH credit. He makes an effort to post many course materials online though, which saves a lot of money.","He's an entertaining lecturer, and the class is pretty straightforward. I got away with not doing most readings, but I never skipped lectures. The papers are graded harsh, but the tests are all multiple choice. It's a lot of work and the writings are really dry, but it's not impossible. The tests contain mostly lecture and recitation material.","Frequently lectures on only a very small portion of the very significant assigned readings. He didn't really know much about Marx, which was disappointing, but still managed to avoid most major errors. Tests are all multiple-choice (and papers count very little) and when not very tricky, are on useless information. TAs make those though, I believe.","Interesting class, but difficult. TAs and recitation very important for understanding and comprehending course material.","An odd one to evaluate. He lives in large lecture  halls, so it's impossible to get to know him. He's a big name in his field. I was reading a Mann story the other day and noticed he was the translator. He's a decent teacher, if aloof. It is fun to hear him translate from Latin, Ancient Greek, German, and French though. Warning: he will curve DOWN!","I don't recommend him unless you're especially interested in philosophy.  The exams are relatively difficult, though not impossible.  He's not always so clear and it's hard to anticipate what will be on them.  Not to mention he curved our first exam grades DOWN.","Great lecturer, has a knack for making very difficult subject matter easier to understand. Its a good thing, for most people german philosophy is pretty hard to understand. Grades are run by TAs- can be pretty hit or miss (mine was fine). I worked hard but don't regret taking the class.","Very interesting professor, knows a lot about his subject. The lectures are very interesting, but it's your job to keep on top of them. Don't be expected to be handed everything on a silver platter. Also, don't fall back on your readings. The TAs aren't that great, they try to do their thing and it doesn't work. Highly recommended class.","He makes boring stuff fairly interesting!","Witty, insightful and wonderful at condensing and clarifying material in lecture, but..lectures and reading don't correspond with each other, paper topics are poorly defined, and TAs are inept. It's extremely frustrating experience, but the class is actually not that hard.","There is no discussion in class; he shows up late, lectures, and leaves five minutes early.  He has unattainable standards regarding what constitutes &quot;H&quot; work, and he doesn't stick to those standards.  Otherwise, this is really not a graduate caliber course.  An easy, albeit frustrating, &quot;P&quot; course.","The material on the tests was unexpected by most of the students and the recitation leaders did little to help.  The lectures were good and clarified the readings well, however, the tests seemed to contain some rather trivial, unexpected questions which made studying difficult.","You read one thing, he teaches another, and you're tested on a third.  He does not hold office hours and the recitation leaders do little to help.  The tests are interpretive but are multiple choice so you can't justify your answer.  Horrible class and professor.","lectures really help clarify some of the dense readings, and he throws in a few funny comments along the way. there's a good bit of reading, but you learn a lot."],"courses":["GERM246","GERM245","GERM245","GERM246","CMPL120","GERM245","GERM246","GERM245","GERM050","GERM55","CMPL242","GERM50","GERM50","GERM50"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"GSLL","catalog_nbr":496,"section":25,"class_nbr":13303,"title":"INDEPENDENT READINGS","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"THORNTON,DAN F","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1108761","fname":"Daniel","lname":"Thornton","quality":"4.3","easiness":"2.2","help":"2.2","clarity":"2.2","topTag":"","grade":"2.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":[],"comments":["Really fun and passionate about Dutch culture.
