Super easy (most kids didn't read at all and still got A's and B's) but you will learn so much if you do the readings. Gabriel is brilliant and leads a very interesting, nontypical lifestyle that is fascinating to hear about when he does share.","very easy-goingnice guy,  really great at teaching, gives a lot of feedback.. definitely would recommend. you have to do a lot of reading for this class and have homework almost every class plus three papers, but overall i don't think the course was too hard.","If you take a deep interest into Literature, he will talk with you in his office hours for as long as you want and furnish you with as many things as you would like.  He is really knowledgeable in multiple areas. For anyone just wanting to learn intro language, he is very clear and will make sure to help you understand something if you are trying.","Herr Trop is an awesome guy who I'd recommend to anyone taking German classes at UNC. I had him for both 302 which is more culture and sociologically based and also 303 which is literature. You can definitely tell he's in his element with literature, he's a really smart guy and also laid back and easy going as a professor. Definitely a cool guy","Awesome guy.  Really lenient, and actually cares about getting you to learn German.  He's also pretty funny, and is quick to respond to emails. Overall awesome dude who I would kill to have to any German class.","Funny, clear, doesn't have an accent."],"courses":["GERM068","290","GERM302","GERM303","GERM302","GERM301"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
