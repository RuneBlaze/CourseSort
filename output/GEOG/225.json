I had her for both GEOG 89 and GEOG/WMST 225. Class is very disorganized but still an easy A. Readings are fascinating. Good discussion. She's very passionate & fun to talk to outside of class. Organization is an issue but I would still recommend. She is the reason I'm a geography major.","She is honestly one of the most enjoyable professors to be around that I have come across at UNC! She is very involved in activism and her community and this translates into her material in a way that is very eye opening and helpful! I have loved her class and would take again! Great professor and person!","I love her! She is one of the best professors I have met in college. I enjoy chatting with her after class and she always gives you the feeling that she is very willing to help! Thank you UNC for hiring such an awesome professor!","She especially did a good job of fairly covering controversial issues. It wasn't hard to figure out what her opinions were, but she stopped well short of any classroom actions I would have found inappropriate. Given that many of her students tend to share her positions, albeit without her tact or professionalism, this stood out to me.","As long as you participate, she will give you a good grade. She lets the class decide what to talk about at length and she is SO friendly and helpful and generally an interesting person."],"courses":["GEOG225","GEOG225","GEOG225","GEOGSECT","GEOG6"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
