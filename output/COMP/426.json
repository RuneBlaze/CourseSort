Be prepared to spend 10-15 hours a week on assignments. You'll also probably spend a lot of time in office hours unless you're already a pretty proficient coder. Exams are really hard and you probably won't finish them in time. If you put in work, a B or higher is attainable though.","Hard assignments, be prepared to work many hours on them.","Great class. You learn a lot and he is very fair with his grading and gives lots of opportunities to improve your grade. Large workload. Doesn't help that he is the hottest professor in US either.","KMP is a great professor; he is very responsive to the students' needs and schedules (like basketball games) and takes input from students when making adjustments to assignments/due dates. Lectures are a bit too long sometimes, but the lecture code and slides help when completing assignments.  Also, he's pure capsaicin when it comes to looks.","KMP is the best lecturer in the Computer Science department at UNC.","He himself isn't super tough but coding the programs in general are difficult if you do not understand the material well. His tests are not that bad if you take them the right way, definitely do the write your own code section on the pretests they are so similar to what will be on the actual test and do that as soon as you finish the multiple choic","Great guy.  Great class.  Lots of assignment extensions.","He's a beautiful human being who speaks with closed eyes and an open heart.  His lecture is a work of art worthy of the snooze through even if you know the material. Would recommend again.","Really fair. Assignments sometimes take longer than expected, but if it is a common problem, he will extend it.","Good professor","Assignments count for a big part of your grade for this class, and their difficulty does tend to ramp up towards the end. You should, however, be able to get a 100% on the assignment portion. Tests are hard mostly because you will probably run out of time, so be quick on those. He explains the concepts well, and is overall a good teacher.","It takes you a long time to do the assignments, but the tests aren't hard if you do the practice tests.","COMP 401 was VERY hard, but I don't think there's a single course I've taken in which I've learnt so much.  Also, KMP is hilarious.","Awesome class! Lectures are super boring, but the assignments make up for it. The assignments are extremely challenging, but fun! 10/10 would take again (:","Great, fun class.  If you're good at programming then the class will be pretty easy.","Hard class but good professor, and you learn a lot.","Great!!!","words and things","he has fun jokes, he tries to be interesting. he tried, even though people cannot resist the sleepyness comes along with the lecture.","KMP has been a fun teacher. He makes a lot of jokes in lectures and cares about his students. He is a cool guy for sure. Assignments tend to be pretty long but I think he is a great professor!"],"courses":["COMP401","COMP401","COMP426","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP426","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401","COMP401"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
