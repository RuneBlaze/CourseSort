It's literally 50% of your grade. The lectures are boring as hell. A bunch of seniors take this class and they aren't the best group mates because they have hardcore seniority. Would not recommend this class. I had this class with Dr. Hazen also and she's not the best."],"courses":["PLCY393"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE"]}}]
