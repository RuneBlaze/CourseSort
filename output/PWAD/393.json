Lectures are really interesting. The recitations involve competitions between teams, which is fun. However, there's a lot to read.","Outstanding professor, probably one of the best I've had in my college career. I am a former science major and have no passion for history classes. Dr. Lee motivated me to attend every one of his lectures, even though attendance was optional. I would recommend this class to anyone, even if you don't enjoy history.","Lee is a great lecturer. Zips through the material so be prepared to take plenty of notes but well worth taking this class.  Grading is up to the TA's so get to know them well.","Dr. Lee will fly through the material- make sure to go to class and take copious notes! The class is difficult not only because of the sheer amount of material, but also because your TA will be doing the majority of your grading. Try your best to figure out what criteria your individual TA is looking for (fancy vocabulary, etc) if you want a n A.","Dr. Lee will fly through the entire history of human warfare in one semester. It is amazing to watch and for the the many students who will only take one military history course he does a great job giving you a lifetime's worth of information. Highly recommended to everyone, PWAD major or not.","Great course. He is a very fun and entertaining lecturer. Be prepared to at least know the general ideas behind all the readings and take good notes. He also brings interesting weaponry to class, so its kind of show and tell!","Very interesting lecturer.  One of my favorite classes at UNC.  Due to the quizzes, it is recommended you attend class, but after listing to Dr. Lee, you won't want to miss.  The final is cumulative but if you do the work, you're fine.  However, there is A LOT of reading.  Overall, a fantastic class and I would definitely  recommend to anyone.","Professor Lee is great- very interesting and energetic. Attending lecture is important for quizzes. Final is cumulative but not too bad. Be prepared for A LOT of reading but his class was great and I would definitely recommend him to anyone!","Professor Lee is such a great teacher! He is knowledgable, energetic, funny, and respectful of student's opinions.  His knowledge of background information not found in the texts enriched the class and made everything very interesting. I'm usually pretty critical of my professors but Lee is definitely one worth taking a class with.","Loved the class- very interesting but be prepared for a lot of reading","Great professor. If you plan on taking a PWAD course, take it with Lee. But, be ready for a lot of reading.","No Comments","Wayne Lee is the man.  Take this class if you can.  Very very entertaining man.  Tests are not too bad.  Just pay attention in class and you'll be fine.","This is the best class I have ever taken.  The man is a genius and has an incredible amount of experience in the PWAD field.  Incredibly animated and entertaining, and tests are not too bad.  Take any class you can with this professor!!!"],"courses":["HIST351","HIST351","HIST351","HIST351","HIST351","HIST351","HIST351","PWAD351","HIST292H","HIST179H","HIST490","PWAD350","PWAD350","PWAD350"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
