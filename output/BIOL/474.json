YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["This guy copyrights all his lectures and will not hesitate to delete google docs. Your grade depends on 3 tests (including the final) so be sure to pay attention during class because he will talk on and on about this subject. He can be funny sometimes, never answers your emails, and does a weird calculation to your grade towards the end","Dr. Sockman is a great lecturer. He's very clear and funny about the topics. However, his slides are all pictures and attendance- while its not taken- is necessary to do well in the class. His class has no grades other than three tests- which may sound daunting but if you go to class everyday and take detailed notes it should be fine.","Professor Sockman single-handedly turn Biol 474 into my favorite class of my entire college career. He discusses a broad range of topics all applicable to almost every bio major class. Stress free class because he breaks everything down and can actually lecture. Definitely stick out the beginning, because he gradually becomes hilarious.","At first, Sockman was kind of intimidating and seemed difficult, but as the class went on he opened up a little and he is rather comical.  There are five tests (all multiple choice) and they are pretty difficult and require a great deal of studying to prepare for them, but there is a good curve at the end of the semester.","Class was not as interesting as I had hoped. Sockman is very friendly and open to questions during class and office hours. Multiple choice tests and final, one test is dropped. But material is detailed and tedious. Much is straight memorization of evolutionary changes but not the purpose behind them"],"courses":["BIOL474","BIOL474","BIOL474","BIOL276","BIOL063"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
