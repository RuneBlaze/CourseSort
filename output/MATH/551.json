Very clear, good lecturing style. His tests are hard, but he grades fairly.","took honors section which was hard, though a good class when one can keep up with the material, often goes to fast and not easy to follow,","Rimanyi is a pretty good teacher, compared to some others at the math department.  He is extremely helpful and is willing to schedule additional office hours if necessary.  The book is very useful in this class and doing extra problems always helps.  As stated already, he does sometimes put questions from the book on the exam.","Very good teacher, fair grading, lectures are very clear.","Decent math teacher, if a stodgy one.  Test scores were low, but curve is generous.  If you totally butcher a test and do well later he's willing to diminish or drop the first exam.  Many of his exam problems were also in the textbook.. if that helps :-)."],"courses":["MATH578","MATH233H","MATH523","MATH547","MATH033"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
