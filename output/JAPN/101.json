Overall, his class is pretty easy as long as you do all the homework and review sheets-- the tests are directly out of the review sheets. If you want to take Japanese, take this professor at all cost!","He's a pretty amusing guy, more than willing to explain things in detail and help you figure out what the issue is when you make mistakes.

Frequent quizzes, but I felt they helped me learn the material since they were always relevant and low content (generally a dozen or so vocab).
