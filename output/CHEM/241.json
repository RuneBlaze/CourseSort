Final is cumulative. You can replace your midterm grades if you do better on that section of the final. But that's not going to happen. Do well and study hard for midterms, because you'll do bad on the ridiculous final. No point of going to class, no attendance grade, no homework, just tests. Sucks. Hard. He doesn't teach well at all.","As far as chem classes go this one was great. Jorgenson writes everything he's talking about on the board, which means its easy to follow and you have plenty of time to take notes. The tests are all multiple choice and they are almost identical to the practice exams. He also lets you replace exam grades with sections of the final which is nice.","Jorgenson has been my favorite professor so far at UNC. Cutest and funniest old man ever. I want to adopt him as my grandpa. Go to class and take good notes, do practice problems and practice exams - you'll be good to go. I even went to a couple of his office hours (basically Q&A sessions) and it helped a ton! Definitely recommend!","He is the cutest old man and is very famous in analytical chemistry. Easiest chem class I have taken. Tests are very similar to his practice exams. Sometimes he just changes the numbers. His lectures are boring and he is a little hard to hear & the textbook is useless (but do the problems he assigns). You can redeem yourself on the final!!","This class was a bore. Poor Jorgenson because he is a really nice man, but the class was so boring that I never went. The final was extremely hard. There isn't much more to say. Chem 241 was one of the worst classes I took here. The only good thong is that he will replace your exam grades with how well you did on final, except the final blows.","He is a great lecturer and goes by a very traditional chalkboard teach method. I would recommend going to his office hours and really studying the practice tests. Even though he is really successful and distinguished in his field, Dr. Jorgenson is so humble and approachable. He will not be teaching for much longer so take his class whe you can!","Great professor. Study your notes and do the practice exams and the assigned problems and you will be fine. I love him, he is adorable and known a lot. I admire him :)","Dr. Jorgenson was great!  I don't know what's up with these other comments, but he was clear, funny, and knew the material well!  Tests were fair, if you went to lecture and did the practice problems, it wasn't too hard to get an A on his exams.  That said, like any chemistry class, going to lecture and doing the homework is easier said than done.","Professor Jorgenson is an AMAZING professor!  He was hilarious!  He did multiple choice tests.  This was my favorite class!  He told stories during his lectures to keep you engaged and they helped you remember the stuff.  I LOVED THIS CLASS!  He is a great man and a great professor.  Not only is he a genius, he invented cappillary electrophoresis!","Professor Jorgenson is very intelligent and knows the subject matter, but that is the only positive thing to say about him.  His teaching skills are lacking. It's great that he understands the material, but he is an ineffective educator.  If you take his class, be prepared to teach yourself and get a good tutor.","Worst professor I've ever had at UNC...or anywhere for that matter.  He is a complete waste of time and energy and a useless human being.  He invented capillary electrophoresis, but the sad thing is HE CANNOT TEACH!  If you can teach yourself, good luck. Otherwise, STAY AWAY FROM HIM and get a prof who knows what he/she is doing!","Nice man, terrible professor.  He is obviously brilliant, but cannot convey the information very well to students.

Compared to many professors who ramble/ stutter, his lectures are extremely organized and coherent. Offers many opportunities to get help outside of class. Exams are hard, but fair (similar to difficult HW problems). Rumored to make people cry, but in reality doesn't seem to be all that bad if you show up prepared.","Dr. Tiani is a great lecturer. His tests (hard) are written on specifically what he talks about in class; the more math heavy questions are from the homework. You really have to \"understand the chemistry\" when taking this class with him. Be strong and study hard; he can be hard on you if you let him-don't let him. He wants you to learn. Final hard","Great professor.  He expects his students to be mature and accountable for their own learning.  Do exactly what he recommends to prepare for tests.  Do the practice problems and come to class.  If you do these things you will find that his tests are very fair.  He really wants everyone to do well.  He is the professor to take for analytical chem.","One of the most difficult courses I've taken at UNC. Extremely tough grader, can be kind of rude to students, made me cry once in office hours.","He explains concepts clearly and is upfront with what he expects of the class. Do your work and you'll be fine.","Great lecturer presents topics very clearly and efficiently. He doesn't mess around in class which was good for someone like me. He gives lots of required homework and some optional problems. If you do all the problems he gives you you should be fine. he is a little unapproachable","To give him credit, Professor Tiani knows gen Chem topics and is solid at teaching them in lectures. Besides that, he is an abysmal professor. Completely unapproachable and rude. Every time he talks to the student its like he's getting in a the ring with them, trying to knock them down with insults and ruin their day.","Everyone told me I would hate Tiani and to switch out but honestly I loved being in his class. His lectures are amazing and yes his personality is a little rough around the edges but he does care for students and cracks a few jokes every now and then. This class isn't for everyone but I do recommend him as a professor.","I really hated this class. He made the concepts sound easy in lecture but then tested us on incredibly difficult problems. I would not recommend him at all.","He is not easily to approach but really does want you to do well. He just makes you work for it more then others.","I had to switch to regular 241 not bc material was hard but bc of his condescending attitude. Also he's needlessly strict about certain things that are a waste of time. For ex, my calculator solves quadratics. He said on an exam Id have to do it by hand to get credit, implying anything else was lazy. Nvm, doing it by hand leads to more errors.","Definitely a hard class but he gives you a lot of opportunity for help. Very condescending, but helpful nonetheless. Tests are hard but doable if you read and do practice problems.","He can be mean sometimes. Make sure not to ask stupid questions. The lab was really tiring. He uses clickers for the lecture quizzes.","He has way too high expectations for a general chemistry class. You have to put in a lot of work to read and do all the online homework. But he's a great lecturer, and I really understood the material just by attending class. I would only recommend him if you want to put in the work to really understand chemistry. If not, then stay away!","Tests weren't too bad for me.","Went in for help and he literally gave me a lecture on how I shouldn't be in his class.","Dr. Tiani is a pretty good lecturer teacher, but beware of office hours.  He is super condescending when you ask questions and makes you feel pretty stupid, even though in lectures he encourages students to stop by. There are also way too many online assignments.  Overall though, if you go to lectures and do the work, you should be fine.","Here's the truth: Tiani is a great lecturer, but everything he teaches can be learned from all of the online homework he gives you. The tests are simple (not easy) but tricky. There's more work than is necessary, and he can be condescending during office hours. Don't take him if you don't have to, but don't lament if you do. It won't be too bad.","HE'S SUCH AN JERK. NEVER ASK HIM A QUESTION. GOD. HE REALLY NEEDS TO RELAX AND BE LESS RUDE TO STUDENTS.","Lecture was interesting, tests were tricky and not easy. If you ask for help, he'll rant about how he already talked about it in class, berate you, and then go over everything.
