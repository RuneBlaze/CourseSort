I'm horrible at English, but she made me a better writer by the end of the semester. Beware: She grades essays harshly, but the grade you earn is the grade you deserve.","Her critiques and grading are overly harsh, without offering any encouragement to motivate the student to want to do better. Her expectations of an intro comp class are unreasonable. To do well in her class, do exactly what she says, leave your creativity at home, and prepare for a ton of inane grunt work.","Dr. Rivard didn't mess around and definitely had high, but fair standards. Always open to meetings and discussions about projects, and really flexible around meeting timesoffice hours.","She was an excellent. I was a little intimidated at first but throughout the course Dr. Rivard proved herself very interested in her students and truly wanted us to excel. She's not afraid to admit when she's wrong and uses current research when teaching her students. She puts a lot of effort into preparing for class and keeps everyone involved."],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENG302","ENGL105"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
