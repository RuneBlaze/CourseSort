There are pop quizzes on the most random things, she gives HUGE amounts of reading plus emails you tons of additional articles, and the tests are unclear. I got a C- on the midterm but still managed to get a B+ in the class, so can't complain. TA's do most of the grading","Really interesting class material, however I hate the grading percentages. Two exams, a few pop quizzes, and recitation participation. The exams and quizzes are either based on random things she finds important or from ridiculously long readings assigned every week. The TA's do all the work in this class but Milada is a good lecturer.","She typically misses several days of class due to research abroad but due to her lack of attendance, she grades pretty easy-- she'll even tell you so.","Excellent Professor; she makes the subject so interesting and fun! She also has great stories to tell of her childhood in the former Yugoslavia.  Very approachable as well and fair on her exams.  I was not surprised by any of the content.  Overall, one of the best political science professors I had at UNC.","What a worthless class.  It's pure history rather than politics.  Vachudova is a nice woman, but she teaches in generalizations and stereotypes, lecture is pointless, and the TAs do all the work in recitation.  Exams are vague and don't test knowledge, rather your understanding of what she wants you to say.  This course is a complete waste of time.","never had poli sci before this class. it wasn't bad considering i'm not the best at politics/history. she's generally late. very helpful if you go see her. i was confused until the exam (which is all short answer) but she gives you credit for putting something down as long as it isn't stupid. try to keep up w/ readings, go to class!","Wonderful teacher.  Very knowledgeable about the subject matter.  Makes things interesting.","Great teacher, entertaining and personable with great stories.  I learned alot too!","Best professor I have ever had, hands down.","The best professor at UNC!  Vachudova is delightful lecturer who incorporates interesting and sometimes hilarious personal stories throughout the course.  The big plus is that she is also extremely personable and invites discussion of any kind during and"],"courses":["POLI236","POLI236","POLI431","EASTEURO","POLI236","POLI236","POLI57121","EASTCNTEUROPE","POLI121","POLI57"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
