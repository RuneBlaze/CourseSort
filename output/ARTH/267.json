You have to memorize 50+ pieces of art (where it's from, who made it, what era, what material, etc) for all tests. Final not cumulative though. TA's grade all papers (two) and are pretty fair. Lectures extremely boring. Skip and read the book instead, it's easier.","Lectures require PRECISE & careful notes. Tests are based on what's covered in lecture; no outlines are posted online, just pictures. You can miss one, two lectures and be screwed. Exams are essay format and require lots of memorization. Tough on papers. Very helpful during office hours. His jokes are terrible but unexpected, which makes them okay.","Dr. Douglas is by far one of the best profs I've had at UNC. You must go to class and take notes, but his lectures are fascinating and he's crystal clear. Very approachable and personable. Great professor.","The hardest class I've taken at UNC.  You must go to class and take very good notes because all exams are essay based.  Get a good TA, they are the sole determinant in your grade.  Would NOT advise taking his 151 class.","His Art History class was fairly difficult, granted I had a god awful TA. You must go to class, you must take thorough notes to do well since all the exams are essay-based.  Would not recommend taking his class at UNC."],"courses":["ARTH277","ART151","ART277","ART277","ART151","ART151"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
