Bruno is the best. Her classes are enjoyable and she is always there for you if you need help. Favorite professor I've had.","Dr. Bruno is literally one of my most favorite professors ever. She is very knowledgeable about not only the language, but the world in general. She takes great effort to make sure all of her students are learning well, and she is an overall great person. I would recommend her class any day!","really rude to her students. she believes she is the only American to have ever learned Spanish, discourages her students and constantly reminds them they will never know Spanish as well as her. the class teaches very little about medical spanish, the course design is terrible","Dr. Bruno is an excellent teacher. She knows exactly what's going on and is extremely helpful. The class is very challenging, but I got a lot out of it.","Dr. Bruno is a nice enough person but she is fairly abrupt in manner and expects students to have a substantial knowledge base before the class begins.  The class is a combination of short essays and daily grammar exercises. All tests are fill-in-the-blank and impossible to study for. But the grading system is very forgiving.","Good class, learned a good bit. Shes really direct but in a good way, very helpful and really wants everyone to learn as much as possible. Homework almost everynight but rarely taken up, go over it in class. Shouldn't get less than a B unless your dumb or excessivly lazy. Liked the class, got more out of it than I had to put in.","Dr. Bruno is Great!  She is extremely nice.  At the beginning of the semester I was dreading her.  But, that turned out to be wrong she is AMAZING.  The entire Spanish for the Professions minor is great!  I loved this class!","SPAN 300 was not a very intense class. I placed into this class after 5 years worth of high school Spanish and a 5 on Spanish Lit. AP and this class was comparable to Spanish 3 or 4 in high school...basically a review of grammar...Dra. Bruno is  nice, friendly, and helpful. I just wish I had leaned more from her class."],"courses":["SPAN329","SPAN300","SPAN321","SPAN300","SPAN300","SPAN300","SPAN321","SPAN300"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
