Expert in his field. I took it over the summer, so no TA's. Midterm was 40%, final was 60%. Very strict grader. For the text, read HIS books (that he wrote)..... you'll learn much more than the assigned readings.","I had Professor Barney for a Civil War course at Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey)in 1975.  Almost 40 years and 3 master degrees later, Professor Barney still ranks as one of my best professors ever.  (And I am happy to report that my youngest daughter will be a freshman this year at Gettysburg College! What irony!!).","He knows the Civil War inside and out, which I thought would be good, but the entire class was just horrendously boring blow-by-blow details of every single battle, troop movement, shot fired, etc. Definitely taught as a PWAD and not a HIST class. Also does not touch on Reconstruction at all, so no clue why that's in the course title.","knowledgeable but terrible teacher. grades papers like hes pissed off and doesnt give advice on them. avoid this guy","Fantastic Professor.  I enjoyed his lectures, and I actually thought that he was very entertaining.  The two midterms are graded by TA's, so if you have a good one like I did, it is possible to succeed.  However, the final is graded by Barney, and he is a Stickler.  You are given the material for the test prior to the test, so STUDY IT ALL!","Dr. Barney rocks! He knows everything about American history and includes really insteresting details in his lectures. Two of the three tests are graded by TAs, so prepare for the final really well because he grades very harshly. This is the most interesting class I've taken at Carolina!","Engaging speaking who loves what he teaches.  Mid-term and Final only -- but very difficult if you are not prepared, and it is critical that you do well on the exams as there is nothing else to off-set your grade.  Makes himself available if you have questions or need help.  Great class!","An interesting and engaging lecturer. You can really tell he loves what he's teaching and he passes it on to his students. The tests are hard, but if you study enough and pay attention in recitations you'll do well. NOT impossible to get an A.","Dr. Barney looks like he stepped right out of the Civil War and his personality fits what he teaches. He can be very interesting at times and very dull at other times. I took his class on the Civil War and he wrote the book which matched his lectures almost word for word. It is an easy class if you are happy with a B it is difficult to get an A.","Class is a challenge, but he is a good professor. Lectures well, I found the subject matter engaging. 1 essay and 2 big tests make up all of your grade, can really be sink or swim. He will give you review guides beforehand, go to the review session held by the TA and study hard. He grades all his finals, TA splits work otherwise.","Barney was a great lecturer, IMO. Much of his grading is done by his TAs so it depends on them. He grades the final and it's hard to determine what he expects because that's all he grades. He gives you test questions in advance and the material is almost all covered in lecture.","Very strict on grading, much of which is done by TA's. Mine was very tough, making taking this class a regret.","This older man is a wealth of information, and has written countless history texts, read the book he assigns (and wrote himself)..BUT his lectures lend themselves to dozing off. Three essay style tests- its IMPOSSIBLE to earn an A.","He knows his stuff, and lectures from start to finish. But he's a stickler, and his TAs determine the grades.","He knew the material, but his TAs give B.S. grades and the class is ridiculously boring. If you take this class, you don't need to go to class, but you do need to be able to write well and a lot on your tests.","BARNEY RULES! I had never learned so much History in my whole life. Mostly political view. He lectures every second of the class and so keep up with the notes and GO TO CLASS. 3 noncumulative essay tests in the semester. Text book will save your life. I highly recommend any of his classes.","Very interesting class, you learn a lot, about things you never have thought about.  But, the tests require a lot of preparation, and it's hard to get an A, well, almost impossible.","A Very dedicated teacher, knows his stuff, i.e. all the books, all the subjects concerning Civil War and Reconstruction.","makes history seem more like a story rather than facts we have to learn... good lecturer","Take good notes and you will do fine."],"courses":["HIST565","CIVILWAR212","HIST565","HIST127","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST560","HIST565","HIST128","HIST128","HIST1100","HIST22","HST022","HIST022","HIST022","254","HST22","HIST100"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"HIST","catalog_nbr":127,"section":6,"class_nbr":8120,"title":"AM HIST TO 1865","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Hanes Art Center","room":"0121","days":"MW","time":"10","instructor":"DUVAL,KATHLEEN A","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["HS"],"enrl_cap":165,"enrl_tot":160,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=784701","fname":"Kathleen","lname":"Duval","quality":"4.3","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"EXTRA CREDIT (2)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","EXTRA CREDIT"],"comments":["Professor DuVal is one of the nicest and smartest professors I've had.
