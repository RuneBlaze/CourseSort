He gives interesting lectures on super cool material and his own work.  Also, he is pretty hilarious.  Don't take this class if political correctness is more important than enjoying your education.","Dr.K is the coolest professor ever.  He's very knowledgeable about electronics, science, and most topics.  His TA grades the lab reports fairly harshly, but it's good experience for later science classes.  If your considering taking phys52: just do it!","Dr. K is a nice and funny person but don't take this class if you aren't already experienced in physics and computer science. I like Dr. K, but as a professor he isn't super helpful unless you are already good at the subject. Also, the labs are graded pretty harshly and you will not finish the labs during lab time usually (you don't get lab cred)","Dr. K is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is incredibly kind and a really great professor. I was lucky to take his FYS which allowed for more interaction.","Professor K is an incredible teacher. He is more than just an instructor. Professor K is a mentor and a guide that will be there for the rest of your time at UNC. The skills I learned in his class (PHYS 52) where invaluable and although it is challenging, I would not hesitate to take it again. Love the man, he has a heart of gold.","I've graduated, and my opinion hasn't changed.  Dr. K is the best professor at UNC.","Professor Karwowski is an amazing teacher.  He was always available for help, funny, taught the material very well, and made my mornings so much brighter.  I'd strongly recommend taking any of his courses, he's fun to be around.","Absolutely fantastic.  He makes going to class something you look forward to.  He'll throw a ton of work at you initially but its not hard to make an A if you apply yourself.  In my opinion hes by far the best professor at UNC.","Definitely not the teacher to take if you haven't had physics before. He expects you to have some background in physics before coming into the class. His lectures weren't really planned that well either.  That being said if you have a good background in physics I would go with him. He does assign a weekly homework assignment, but it's not that bad.","Karwowski makes getting up at 8 AM bearable.  His class was not as hard as he &quot;jokes&quot; that it is, I personally felt it should have been harder(this might have motivated me to not do my homework the night it was due every time.  do your homework early, and in different locations, you'll meet people.  this class was very social)","Hugon was the best professor I have had at UNC.  If you get the chance, take his class!  He will be a very difficult teacher during the year, as his problem sets rae meant to really challenge you, but his tests and exams were not horribly difficult and he rives some favoralbe curving towards the end.  He will also keep you laughing and engaged!!!","Hugon is one of the best professors at UNC. He assigns hard homework, but his tests are pretty easy, and he counts the PHYS 116 lab for a very small portion of your grade. He is friendly, helpful, and full of irreverent humor.","Hugon is an amazing professor.  I was in the 116 course for people intending to major in Physics.  It was very difficult, but a lot of fun.  We didn't use the book at all, and he made up his own (very difficult) homework problems, but they were always quite entertaining.","This is the old phys 101 (electronics).  He's a great guy and very willing to help you, but the class is slightly frustrating.  Often he is not clear in class, and he assigns extremely hard homework to force you to figure out what he hasn't covered in lectures on your own.","He is the best professor I have ever had! I recommend him to anyone new to physics. His lectures are entertaining and has many office hours and review sessions.","I consider Hugon to be the best teacher i have had to date at unc","This was definetly one of the hardest classes that I have taken here.
