He made me look at economics in a different way. His exams are straight forward and he tells you what he expects out of you. I would highly recommend taking a class with him!","This professor on point! He's  always there to answer questions, & he gives clear, patient, & helpful explanations. He teaches to the readings and explains clearly what everyone needs to know for exams, etc. Honestly if you don't do well, you didn't attend class, or were sleeping or playing dota and you deserve it. Upfront opinion. He is the best!","Not too difficult, knows his stuff and very interesting","Professor Rosefielde tells some great jokes and really knows what he is talking about.  His tests are all essay questions and he gives you the questions ahead of time.  So, you can go into the test knowing exactly what to write, and he grades very easily.  I never had to use the textbook.  Only downside: very early classes.","Dr. Rosefielde is a relic of non-mainstream economics (he boasts how he is a Sovietologist). His course comprises of his self-referenced book criticizing mainstream economics. Therefore, to do well in the course, you only need to regurgitate his lectures--unfortunately, believing the validity of such theories is another thing.","Professor Rosefielde is an amazing professor -- one of the best. His courses are advanced and largely left up to the students to take advantage of. You'll do a lot of the course readings on your own, and then he helps to clarify and organize the information. He's a really really impressive teacher, I wish that more were like him.","He knows a lot of cool info that you wont get elsewhere - which is fun. And most of the semester passed with little to no work, but the end was hard - i dont think he realized that though. Great guy","a brilliant professor who has a tough time fostering dialogue. nonetheless, a very informative lecturer, a keen scholar in his discipline, and overall a really fascinating class. you know explicitly exam content, but even then preparation takes time.","Tells you exactly what's on test... great class.","he is very funny, no assignments other than reading, 1 optional test and a final, gives questions for the exams","No Comments","No Comments"],"courses":["ECON468","ECON468","ECON468","ECON267","ECON469","ECON67","ECON006","ECON67","ECON67","ECON67","ECON","ECON168"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
