Great class. If you like thinking deep about political economy, marx, telecommuncation, internet etc, I recommend this class. But if you are not interested in the class topics, not read the class materials and don't engage in the class discussion; it may be a very difficult class.","Honestly one of the best professors I've ever taken a class from. His classes were so interesting that I emailed him before my last semester to see what courses he was teaching so that I could take another one with him. The Ted Mosby of UNC","The lecture consisted of Dr. Palm pacing in front of the class, asking rhetorical questions that he never answered and that didn't matter. Three papers, but absolutely no guidelines. Not even a topic. Even made five pages very difficult. The screenings were kind of interesting, but overall I left still wondering what the purpose of the class was.",""],"courses":["COMM650","650","COMM140","COMM140"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
