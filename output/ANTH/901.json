He tells lots of interesting stories about his personal stories and always tries to make you laugh and keep you engaged in a big lecture.  The only thing that was frustrating was how specific the tests were.  He gives study guides but they are way different from the tests.  random specifics","Really liked this class! Laid-back atmosphere and West tells great stories about his kids and the field work that he's done. The subject matter was interesting and not difficult. Would definitely take a class with him again!","Probably my favorite class b/c of West. He is very passionate about what he does and it's clearly evident. He's done a lot of field work, so class is interesting b/c he'll have \"West story time\" and never fails to make the class laugh. He assigns readings but I never read and have an A.

He's such an interesting person and won't fail to make you laugh during class.","Coolest professor. He loves to tell (relevant) stories about his field work and his kids.

Awesome class and he knows the topics and readings","West is great! decided to take ANTH 459 b/c I thought it sounded interesting, not thinking it was too high of a level for my year/major. However, it was my highest grade (A)! Not too much work, just a lot of reading. But he sympathizes when the reading is boring, so dont stress about tough ones.

People who complain are those who don't do those things, but it's really so easy if you just do those simple things. Easiest class and filled a Gen Ed too!","Please don't take this class. Just save yourself the annoyance and go ahead and take this off your schedule for this year. She is seriously the most patronizing woman ever. Her material is absolutely pointless and she seems utterly unprepared for every lecture. Just terrible.","This class was supposed to be easy, but instead it is really boring. The professor is a cool lady, but extremely monotone. The material is not very interesting either, and the tests are kind of difficult.

She likes it when people put in a clear effort, that's all.  Two papers, two exams.","I thought the class was extremely easy. If you're looking for a great way to fulfill a VP requirement, take this class. As long as you review your notes prior to taking any kind of exam and you go to class, you will get a good grade. Attendance was never taken during lecture, however it is taken during recitation. Recitations are every other week.","Exams are all different and she makes no effort to prepare the class for them.

His classes, even his introductory ones, are not easy. You gotta put in the work, especially on exams and written work. Like bones? Take him.","Pay attention in class, he has questions on the test about his 20 second off-handed remarks. Expects you to remember everything. Gives study guides, then the test is on different content. The tests have TRICK QUESTIONS. He focuses too much on minute details and name-dropping. Pure rote memorization, doesn't give a bigger understanding of the world.","Anth 50 was interesting and boring all at the same time. I liked the forensics topics, but I wasn't in to the bioarcheology topics at all. The lectures were dry, but the group projects were fun. However, the fun projects weren't worth a semester of boring lectures and reading assignments. Dale is a good teacher, but the just class wasn't for me.","Professor Hutchinson clearly loves his field of study and is very knowledgeable about human origins, but he had a difficult time conveying the information in a helpful way. His powerpoints were very disorganized, and sometimes the information was out of date or did not align with what was in the textbook. I wish there had been more consistency.","Fantastic professor! I took his ANTH 50 class and it was the most enjoyable course I took all semester. His lectures are engaging and always interesting. Not to mention we handled real skeletons! The readings are interesting as well, and are very good books.","416 involves 3 group projects, 1 case study paper, and a final exam, all which are decently graded if done correctly. Also, final exam is given to you and you may bring a 2 page cheat sheet. It definitely comes in handy being familiar with anatomical terms before this course. Interesting course about diseases, the dead, and archaeology","The 3 exams involve a lot of memorization, and reading the novel and textbook is essential in order to do well. Lectures are often confusing, but the textbook may clarify the lecture concepts. There is also a paper, and its requirements are clearly outlined with examples. There are lecture & recitation attendance grades, so always attend class!","I had him as a professor my first semester at UNC and found it very difficult to do well in his class (as compared to all of my other classes). He is very vague during lecture and provides a lot of material without really explaining its relevance. If you do not read the textbook, you will not pass.","lectures were very confusing and i learned everything from the textbook. the exams are all multiple choice consisting of memorization.","This is the most interesting class I have taken in college. Dale looks a lot like an archaeologist and he fits the position perfectly. Tests were difficult for me as a math major: pure memorization and LOTS of it. The average on the midterm was a C-, but the final was easier and he added bonus questions. This class was a lot of work but worth it.","Definitely looks like an anthropologist. This class was hard, a lot of memorizing material to be honest. The field is constantly changing so the material actually changed a little while learning it. Look in the text book for the stuff you don't understand and ask the TAs. Not an easy A, and attendance is mandatory, but it wasn't the worst class.","His class was overall very interesting! At times the course material could get a little boring but he adds in stories and experiences to  liven it up. All you really have to do to get a good grade are go to class and study some for the exams!","Super engaging and enthusiastic professor who, imo, makes lectures very interesting. Tests are all multiple choice, matching, and true/false, which isn't too difficult. You'll watch a lot of film. *Note: He assigns readings in the textbooks for every class, but you never actually use it in class, and only have one paper related to them.","If you don't mind memorizing long lists of fossils, their location, the researchers who found them, the time it was discovered, what soil it was in, etc, etc, etc, then take this class. It really was just tedious memorization, which of course I soon forgot. Hutchinson is nice, but it doesn't make up for the class on the whole.","Best professor ive had so far. very clear, willing to give multiple definitions, examples are very good and help you understand more complex topics, and he looks the part! if u want to take anth take it with him","He's really interesting in the topic, but the material is confusing. There are no hard facts, but the tests are all multiple choice, which makes things confusing. I got two C- on my midterms and still managed to pull out an 88 in the class. He weighs attendance as much as exams so GO TO CLASS!","Most interesting class I've taken at UNC. Professor Hutchinson is extremely approachable and willing to give you all the help you need to understand the material.","Dr. Hutchinson is really excited and enthusiastic about teaching biological anthropology and is extremely helpful if clarification is needed. Although the subject matter can get a little dry at times, he was a pretty engaging teacher and we watched a lot of film. If you go to class and read, you will get a good grade.","This class was horrendously boring. Hutchinson just shuffled around and talked in a monotone voice about fossils without really discussing the relevance of what we were learning. Just a lot of memorization and redundancy.","It's been a few years but Dale was amazing.  I had him for 2 classes in the same semester and it was both the most challenging and the best semester I had at UNC.  Very approachable and highly interested in his students."],"courses":["ANTH50","ANTH148","ANTH50","ANTH148","ANTH50","ANTH416","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH123","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTHR147","ANTH414","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH414"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ANTH","catalog_nbr":901,"section":86,"class_nbr":16489,"title":"READING & RESEARCH","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"ARBUCKLE,BENJAMIN S","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":10,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2063152","fname":"Benjamin","lname":"Arbuckle","quality":"4.7","easiness":"1.8","help":"1.8","clarity":"1.8","topTag":"Respected (2)","grade":"1.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["PARTICIPATION MATTERS","HILARIOUS","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","LOTS OF HOMEWORK"],"comments":["Funny, nice guy. Gives clear lectures and does not over-complicate things. Five assignments based on relatively short readings. One midterm and a final. Tests are entirely based on what he says in lecture. Although archaeology is not my area of study, I found this class to be relevant and interesting. Worth your time if you need an ANTH credit.","I love Professor Arbuckle! He's so much fun and makes the class really interesting. He's dedicated to the subject matter and often talks about research he has done. I don't think I went a single class without laughing at something he did or said. You have to read articles and write 1-page summaries on them but its not too bad! Love this guy!","Benjamin is a baller. He is so good at archaeology and makes his lectures super easy to understand. The class is stupid easy, but it's so interesting that you WANT to pay attention. The tests are ridiculously easy, and he's just a really cool guy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone to meet this guy and take this class.","Professor Arbuckle is very straightforward with his class policies and expectations. As long as you go to class, do the minimal amount of homework, and study for the tests it should be an easy A.  He is very passionate about archaeology and makes little jokes to make lecture more interesting. Would always recommend this class!","This guy is my favorite teacher.  He's really funny, helpful, and clearly passionate about the subject.  You have to write one page summaries for every class but they're not that bad and he is very fair.  10/10 would take again."],"courses":["ANTH233","ANTH65","ANTH149","ANTH149","ANTH65"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
