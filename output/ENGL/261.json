The class was extremely unorganized and in the span of two days we had 18 pages of writing assigned to us simply because she could not keep up with her earlier deadlines. Although she is certainly intelligent, she shows no signs of making her class a priority. DO NOT TAKE","She is very smart, but sometimes too much for the good of the class. Never returns papers that are assigned, and moved around deadlines and assignments because she took so long grading papers. The class on a day to day basis was discussion. You have to keep up with the reading because she randomly calls on students!","She is very smart but doesn't convey the material well. Some of the things she taught didn't seem relevant to what the class was supposed to be about. When she spoke to you it seemed like she was speaking down to you. She had an arrogant air about her when she talked and it made me wary/ uncomfortable to go to her for help.","Dr. Fisher is intelligent, and expects a TON from her students.  I think that the course load was extremely high for a first-year seminar.  Also, Dr. Fisher is not an easy grader by any stretch of the imagination.  If you are a freshman looking for a stress-free seminar, this might not be the one for you.  Although, you would certainly learn a lot!","Like others have said, she's a very intelligent and well spoken woman. I definitely learned a lot from her. I do think she expects too much and grades papers hard. You cannot miss more than 2 classes without having your grade lowered & you MUST keep up with readings because she will call on anyone at anytime.","took Intro to Literary Criticism with her and was blown away. Her class is intense - you're very much expected to participate, so you better keep up with the readings. She's a brilliant professor and incredibly well spoken, and she definitely wants her students to succeed. Try to take a class with her if you can!","Dr. Fisher was an amazing teacher - incredibly smart (almost too smart) and interesting, but I found the courseload way too high for a first year seminar. I learned a lot and I think I'm a better writer because of the class, but if you're interested in her class be prepared to write a TON."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL129","ENGL128","ENGL86","ENGL283","ENGL261","ENGL086"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
