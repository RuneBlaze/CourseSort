Good use of technologies, lots of individual help. Learning Chinese is very hard, but Lin laoshi makes it enjoyable. Looking forward to CHIN 203!","Lin Laoshi is very sweet and is there for help if you ask her.  She responds quickly to emails and will even help you practice speaking Chinese outside of class.  Grammar points in Chinese are difficult, but she tries to explain them to the best of her abilities.  Overall, a good professor.","Lin Laoshi is strict but very helpful and kind. If you ask for help, she will have tutoring sessions with you to help you.","Lin Lao shi is strict but very helpful and kind. If you ask for help, she will have tutoring sessions with you to help you.","She is extremely hard and doesn't explain things very clearly, her tests are pretty hard in terms of the grammar portion and she expects you to come into this class with already having a ton of experience with speaking chinese. I would not take this class with Professor Lin if possible","She's a wonderful person, very sweet. We have trouble understanding grammar points sometimes, mostly because they can be so atypical, but as a class, we talk it out with her help. Really enjoyed her as a teacher for 102 and 204","Very weak teacher overall. She often gives unclear explanations of grammar, and is rarely able to give satisfactory answers to questions. Her tests are relatively easy, but they occasionally include material that has not been covered in class. In class. speaks.more English than Chinese and gives unclear directions for exercises. Much wasted time.","She is a very sweet teacher, and unintentionally funny sometimes, but her methods of teaching aren't nearly as clear as other Chinese language professors at UNC. She is not helpful in terms of helping you in Chinese, but if you need to miss class or re-schedule a quiz, she is pretty lenient."],"courses":["CHIN101","CHIN101","CHIN102","CHIN102","CHIN212","CHIN204","CHIN102","CHIN102"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","POOR"]}}]
