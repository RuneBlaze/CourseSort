His lectures are so boring, but what more do you expect from medieval history. The recitation is not bad, just discussion about the reading.","Dr. Bull is a brilliant man, but his lectures can be extremely boring.  The papers make up most of your grade, and since a TA grades those, I felt like the TAs graded too harshly and Bull was not willing to listen to this or help.","One of the best professors I've had. Engaging, knowledgeable, friendly, with a great sense of humor. Rare mix of expertise in the field with passion for teaching. In my opinion, HIST 437 is a must-take for history majors. I looked forward to his lectures in both courses, and the papers and exams were straightforward. Thank you Dr. Bull, and cheers!","He's an okay professor. Lectures can get boring and drag on. If you keep up with the readings you'll be fine. Just be prepared to read a lot each week; no breaks.","Professor Bull is an awesome guy! He's British and has a very sarcastic sense of humor. Overall, his lectures are always extremely organized and he posts schematics of them online. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he knows a lot about his subject, so it's a good idea to go. Great professor!","He's very entertaining and engaging. He is very clear in what he expects of you and is very knowledgable of his topics. Very likable and cheerful. Great teacher."],"courses":["HIST107","HIST107","HIST434HIST437","HIST107","HIST107","HIST434"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
