The material is relatively interesting and he wasn't a tough grader. Maybe not an easy A class, but with some effort you should be fine. Reading isn't mandatory and he doesn't take attendance, but showing up to class is important to understand the material.","Professor Watson is very knowledgeable and his lectures were actually interestinginsightful, but reading the textbook is an absolute MUST for success. He doesn't really teach the plain and simple facts that you must know for the midterms - he just assumes you know it, and dives into deeper ideasside stories.","Professor Watson is incredible! He knows more than almost anyone else will ever know about the antebellum American South. He is friendly, brings a smile and a good attitude to class and is always well prepared and clear in his lectures. I am a history major and he is the best history professor I have had at Carolina.","Very interested in material, but not the best speaker. Could be soporific if you don't bring a caffiene infusion. Do the reading and take good notes! Talk to your TA about the essays and preview the exams. You should do fine.","I hate History, but his class was still one of the best I have had thus far.  His lectures are interesting, and he constantly repeats topics that are prominent on the exams.  Pay attention and contribute in reciation because it effects your participation grade and the TA's impression of you.  He/she will be grading your work.","Really loves the course material.  Very excitable on class.  Lots of reading but not too bad.  Doesn't give study guides so you've got to have a broad understanding of the course material come exam time.  Discussion sections provide insight and clarifying.    Cares about his students.","Professor Watson is very nice.  The course readings can be VERY long and sometimes repetitive, but they are original documents and not simple tellings of the history (you have to go to lecture to get that).  The recitations require critical thinking.  This was a very enjoyable class; I recommend it."],"courses":["HIST336","HIST127","HIST586","HIST365","HIST022","HIST22","HIST66"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
