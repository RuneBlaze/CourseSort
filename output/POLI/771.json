Politics is my thing, philosophy isn't, but professor Spinner is an amazing lecturer and overall instructor. Very passionate about what he teaches and makes you think and question everything. He's tough though, so get ready to read and study. The class is doable, but you have to be willing to work hard.","Dr. Spinner is honestly one of the best teachers I have had. Although the reading was dense and difficult to understand, the class discussion made it so that we knew what the important parts were. He assigns papers more than tests, take into account improvement, and gives honest, constructive criticism. You should be willing to put in the effort.","Professor Spinner is amazing. I loved this course! But it is not for the lazy student. You have to read, and you have to come to class. But do it! A really good class.","I feel like I learned a great deal in this class, but the TA grading is very inconsistent and the smallest of errors may eliminate any chance you had of getting an A. Tons of reading, though I sort of liked it because I had always wanted to read the great political philosophers but lacked the motivation. Take only if very interested in the subject.","Unclear lectures and unclear readings are individually not enough to ruin a class but this is one situation where the two meet. Expect excessive amounts of what feels like unnecessary reading because even when you do it it's entirely possible to misconstrue it and get screwed on an essay or exam. Take if you need to but don't expect a fun time.","Difficult course, huge amounts of reading; most of which is dry and, at times, beyond comprehension. Still, Prof Spinner will offer you extra help if you ask him for it. He does come off as intimidating, but in the end, he bent over backwards to help me through the course material. NOT for slackers.","Definitely a difficult class.  Don't take this just to knock off a gen. ed requirement.  That's what I did, but luckily I realized I really enjoyed the material.  I learned a lot.  Take this if you genuinely have an interest in the subject.  Professor Spinner-Halev's lectures get redundant but he knows what he's talking about.  Overall a good guy.","This class was extremely, extremely difficult. I mistakenly took this class my first semester of my freshman year...DO NOT repeat this egregious mistake. I struggled initially, but I actually performed well overall. My TA saved my grade...I went to her during office hours for help nearly every day. Work in groups for these exams.","This class was insanely difficult. The teacher talks incredibly fast so be ready to type. Attendance is not mandatory but you better go or have notes from someone in the class. The reading is difficult with about different authors who all have similar concepts you must be able to recall. The TA's grade all tests and papers-they are extremely picky!","Spark Notes will not save you when it comes to this class. You better be prepared to do some serious reading (in old-school language!) Also, the grading on papers and exams was ridiculous.","Although lecture attendance is not required, if you plan on doing well in the class, lecture is extremely helpful.  Professor Spinner-Halev does a nice job of explaining the confusing theoretical concepts, especially when it comes to digesting the dense amount of reading material assigned.  The TA's grade the work and can be nit-picky graders.","The class itself was definitely difficult, but I thought that he was very good at explaining complicated concepts. You definitely need to go to lecture to understand the readings and know what the main points are. I thought that exams and papers were tough but were graded fairly.","Don't take this class if you don't like to do readings or speak in class discussions because that's all this class is. Dr. Spinner-Halev is extremely knowledgeable and leads the discussions well but the class content comes from the class. He does seem to acknowledge that the subject matter is quite complicated and is a very fair grader.","Tons of reading.He keeps the lectures about as interesting as you can make modern philosophy.All the grading is done by TAs though;I got a bad one and ended up with horrible grades while my friends turned in comparable work to other TAs and got 95s and higher.Went to him for help once and he was very helpful, although he comes off as intimidating.","The tests and papers aren't so much difficult, but they are graded extremely toughly.  A 90 is as high as it gets on any assignment (no matter how good it is), but the TAs do all the grading. The prof was very helpful when I went to see him though.  You must go to class to understand what's going on.","Not helpful; rather cold. Lectures are long and intense--though you should definitely attend to understand the philosophers. Exams and papers are very difficult and graded harshly."],"courses":["POLI271H","POLI270H","POLI271H","POLI271","POLI271","POLI471","POLI271","POLI271","POLI271","POLI271","POLI271","POLI271","POLI276","POLI271","POLI271","POLI271"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
