Very boring lecturer and usually students quit coming to class except for tests. Tests were more challenging than homework problems. About 4 hours homework weekly. Easy final.","Her lectures are very boring and almost pointless to go to she simply does the practice problems that are already done in the book. It is very hard to pay attention and enjoy the class.","She is very poor at teaching and her exams are not reflected of the course material.  This course made me really regret choosing the major that I am in.  Do not take this class unless you absolutely must!"],"courses":["BMME160","BMME160","BMME160","BMME160"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR"]}}]
