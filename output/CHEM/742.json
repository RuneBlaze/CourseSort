Generous curve as well. Recommend!","Never heard of Glish prior to taking his Chem 241 class, but he quickly turned into my favorite teacher at UNC.  Must do all readings and work tons of problems.  Very approachable if you have any questions and is fair about point-spreads and test curves.  Tests will challenge you and you review old material for the final. Got a B.

Luckily, if we scored an A on the final we got an A (I got an A).  His teaching was not that great and the book was more clear than him.","Absolutely terrible.
