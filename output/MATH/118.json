He really cares about what he's doing and it shows when you're sitting in class. He's extremely nice and funny and cares about his students success. Always posts a practice exam and homework questions are similar to test questions.","Mela is the man, he shows up to class with his brain and some chalk and kills it. His class is tough, but multi is tough. The way he thinks about calculus is more of a natural/conceptual way of thinking, very helpful in learning. Practice outside of class is everything. If you average an 80ish you'll get an A-, he's trying to pass you. Great guy.","Mela always cracks jokes in class. Take 381 with him! Best professor for it. His tests were hard and a time crunch for me, but he has a curve at the end of the course.","Take Mela! Don't even question it. He's the actual funniest of the math professors here and will  keep you engaged in class. I felt very comfortable going to his office hours, and he'll even try to give you partial credit back if the graders screw you over. Curve is added at the end of the semester since test averages are usually between 60 and 73.","Mela is really funny and obviously likes math, so that always makes for a good teacher. He moves pretty fast, and the tests are REALLY hard. He's pretty good about curving though.","Professor Mela is an awesome professor! His teaching is engaging and he really does present and explain the material well. The way he organizes everything on the board as he teaches is great. He's also hilarious and very nice. Math381 isn't the easiest course, but if you go to class it shouldn't be too difficult to succeed with mela","Took 233, 381, and 383 with Mela. One of the best math instructors I've had at UNC, really approachable and fair.","He wasn't that bad of a teacher, his test questions were harder than questions we practiced in class.  There was a big curve on the tests and on the final.","Mela is hilarious, which makes lectures entertaining. He is also very clear and exams mimic in-class examples and homework, which means there are no surprises on the tests! I am taking him again next semester for diff eq!","Good solid lecturer. Very funny and lighthearted. Generally speaking, test questions are similar to in-class proofs so review your notes. Fair grader though 50 minute exams can be a time-crunch.","Best teacher I've had so far, although, I'm just a freshman. Funny, intelligent, and has what's best for his students at heart. I'm taking his 383 class next semester. 233 was not all that hard. People say the tests were hard but I didn't think they were bad at all. As long as you put in the work and are decent at math you should be fine.","Hilarious guy, but the tests are just insanely, ridiculously hard for me (I did well in AP BC calc in high school). He was very generous with curves and partial credit, thank god. Two quizzes, three tests (including a cumulative final) and WebAssign homework. Never failed to have a good laugh in his class, he does take forever to grade.","This was one of the worst experiences I had at Chapel Hill. On one quiz, he posted everyone's grades outside his office (rude) and the vast majority of students made a 4 out of 10. No curve. He's difficult to understand, mocks students who don't get the material, and works entirely in deep theory. Hilarious guy, but horrible teacher.","Very nice professor, but he's difficult to understand and moves very quickly.","Professor Mela is a great guy, and a wonderful teacher. Math 383, aka Intro to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations, was harder than it should have been though. He asks a lot of hard, conceptual questions on the homework- but if you get them correct, you have an excellent grasp on the material. The exams and quizzes were easy and fair.","Xavier is HILARIOUS. Please take his class.","Really great instructor.  flexible office hours, a lot of examples, and clear tests","Awesome teacher.  Made class interesting, plenty of examples, and the homeworks and tests followed his examples.  Graded fair and canceled class alot!","Prof. Mela was very funny, friendly, and made calc 3 fun.

Bit of a slow grader, but not so much that it bothered me.  Definitely take him if you have the chance.","McCombs had a really rough semester, but he still found a way to be a great professor. He's a really nice guy and he loves his school. Homework is given weekly, but you complete it in recitation so it's an easy A.  Will bump up your grade if he can. Not super responsive with emails, but he really cares about his students' success.","McCombs is cool and relatable and is very thorough and clear in his lectures. His class is very easy and great for humanities majors (like myself).","Professor McCombs describes his course as \"for people who want to learn math and live to tell about it.\" If you want an easy math that makes sense in the concrete and is designed for humanities majors, I would strongly recommend this class.","Professor McCombs is very funny and likable. The material was pretty easy but be careful because he grades tests very strictly. You don't really even have to go to class since all the notes are posted online.","HE IS AMAZING! I had the absolute best time in Math 110. I would take any course taught by Mr. McCombs! If you struggled with math or simply don't enjoy it, I recommend taking a course with Mr. McCombs because he is truly helpful and committed to his students.

No tricks or overly difficult questions on tests.","Professor McCombs is funny and nice, but he misses class too much, leaving us to be taught by second-rate professors.
