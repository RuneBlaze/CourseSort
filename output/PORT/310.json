Patricia is very helpful and she is passionate about what she teaches. She will only speak portuguese in her class which is very helpful if you are trying to improve your vocabulary and knowledge of words. If you are intending to take a 300 level class in portuguese don't expect to be spoken to in english.","Before I had Patricia, I heard that she insisted on speaking in Portuguese and was difficult to work with. However, she was very helpful with our class. A lot in-class activities. Good sense of humor. While she likes to make class fun, she doesn't tolerate misbehavior. Exams and assignments are very easy too.","I've taken a lot of Portuguese classes and she's definitely the hardest teacher. Getting Bs is easy, but she never gives out As. Ever. She never speaks in English, which is ok in higher classes, but it was so unhelpful in the lower classes. She's nice to people she likes, but don't expect much help from her unless you grill her.","She rarely speaks in English, so that is irritating. Exams are easy enough, but go to class since she likes to throw things in on exams that were not covered in the textbook, (or that she taught differently.)  She tries to make it fun, but it ends up being aggravating and a chore to listen to her.","I had her for 101 and 102.  Mainly talks in Portuguese which gets annoying.  But she is a young and tries to be fun."],"courses":["310","PORT203","PORT310","PORT101","PORT101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
