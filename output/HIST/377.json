She is knowledgeable about her areas of interest. She is more than just a professor. At times she can be a friend, mother and confidante. I've never had a professor at UNC like her. She genuinely cares for the well-being of all of her students. You must constantly communicate w/ her to keep from getting lost.","Didn't know what the heck she wanted from me (the whole class felt the same) at the beginning of the semester. I thought it would get better and I would know what to do, but it didn't. Confusion and frustration.","I took her for my history seminar course about African American female activists.  The class was very small and intimate, and I felt like she really cared (she would give us days off to work, bring in desserts, spend time asking how we are doing and personal lives.)  However, we taught the class to each other, and when she spoke I zoned out.","She is really nice and very smart, but a horrible teacher. It is not organized and you'll be confused most of the time. That being said, the class is really easy as long as you know her and have a relationship with her. She tries to help, but isn't a good teacher. Nice woman though."],"courses":["HIS581","128","HIST395","HIST377"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
