The only problem is that he's not good at helping the class do well. One lecture might cover a whole chapter, another might cover one or two sections of a chapter. He spends too long on derivations, and not enough time ensuring class understanding. Prepare to teach yourself","Considering the overall quality of teachers in this department, he's not bad.  He knows his stuff, but is not very clear so you don't loose much by not coming.  Schroeder's book was very helpful...usually much clearer than Wu.  Tests are not very difficult.  Fair in partial credit, so at least put down the correct formula if you are out of time.","Great professor and great person. Once you get over accent, very very helpful. Let class go because only few people showed up after a 21st b-day celebration :) .","Hard, but not difficult to understand. His tests are not impossible if you study well.

If you don't understand something, he will explain it again and again (in a different way each time), until you understand it. He encourages questions, and is a very fair professor.","When you are new to the material, you may get a sense that Sean's explanations are hasty and incomplete but you'll second guess yourself: \"maybe it's just me, maybe I should focus on this lecture and then I'll get it\". Wrong - his explanations truly are hasty and incomplete. Come to class, take detailed notes, but learn from TEXTBOOKS W SOLUTIONS!","Respectable professor. If you need help, he will make time. Behind the sarcasm, he's a great professor.","Horrible lecturer.  Makes you feel terrible for asking questions. Avoid.","Made it clear from day 1 he didn't care about this class or anyone in it. Scheduled appointments with him 4 times and he didn't bother to show up every time.","One of the best professors at the University.","Boo.","I had a lot of trouble in this class but I'm not a Physics person. Sometimes he didn't explain things very well. But he was really nice and laid back. A lot of people got As and Bs in there.","Sean is a very awsome and funny guy, however he was a pretty horrible 101 teacher (but he hates that class, so he is a much better teacher in 103).  He makes you feel like he hates answering your questions and that you are really really dumb, but in fact he loves when you ask him questions and just likes picking on you, that's his natural state :P.","Very approachable and friendly. Truly cares about you understanding the material. Lectures are difficult to decipher sometimes, and he has a habit of making you feel dumb if you don't immediately grasp concepts. Office hours are a must.
