She talks quietly and teaches using figures on a powerpoint. As long as you take notes during lecture and read, you should be fine. She gives you a lot of practice exams, and her tests are VERY similar to some of the questions she gives as practice. She teaches the molecular portion.","Dr. Searles is probably one of the better science professors I've had at UNC, especially when it comes to explaining concepts and being knowledgeable in her field, which is important when people are asking off-the-wall questions.  She was very approachable in office hours and I felt like she wanted me to succeed.  Tests were extremely fair!!!","Dr. Searles is great for the second half of 202. She's hard, but her tests are very fair and straight for lecture material. Definitely read and do recitationSI problems.  Very helpful in office hours.  Provides lots of practice exams for each test.","For molecular half of class. Her lectures can get a git boring at times and I have to wake up. If you pay attention she does lay out the material well and answers questions. Her tests are hard but fair and not tricky. Compared to other bio teachers her tests are a relief, but all short answerfill in. Recitation problems are important.","I had her for the Molecular half of 202 and it was TERRIBLE. Boring and unclear lectures and the test? Very hard. She seems like a nice person though","This was a challenging but very rewarding course.  We focused on learning to read scientific papers.  each week a few students presented but all had to participate.  Dr. Searles put in a lot of time making sure you were ready for your presentation and we learned a lot!","Terrible lecturer, but her tests are fair. Do all your recitation problems and make sure you understand them before exams."],"courses":["BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","202","BIOL202","BIOL590","BIOL202"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL"]}}]
