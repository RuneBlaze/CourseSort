Europe. He can be hard to understand at times and he has a strange sense of humor. With any background in calculus this class will be too easy for you. No background.. this will require a good bit of work. Gabor over-complicates everything. HW is sorta a bit much & there is arbitrary extra credit. Tests are alright.","Gabor is an extremely tough grader, and his tests don't have many questions so making a minor mistake on a single question is the difference between an 100 and an 80. He has a thick accent and is not very charismatic, seems very detached from the needs of his students, sometimes treating us like were idiots and sometimes like graduate students","Hands down the worst class I've taken at Carolina. My biggest complaint about Gabor is that he doesn't give partial credit on exams, which earned me a terrible grade in a class that was supposed to be a refresher. Besides that, he is kind of a jerk to students, and is pretty arrogant. He will call on you in class if he thinks you're not listening.","This class isa mix of Algebra 2  and applied Calc 1. That being said, Gabor overcomplicates the material to an extreme. He's not the fairest, and his extra credit system is super arbitrary, but he is pretty knowledgeable and makes sure that you understand why formulas are the way they are. Not a great prof, but might be best for STOR 113","Worst teacher I have ever experienced at UNC. Avoid taking a class with him at all cost. The class I am taking now was supposed to be easy, but he has made it 1000 times harder than it needs to be.","This is a \"wake up, you are not in Kansas (ie highschool) anymore kind of class. You need to be prepared in precalc, and if you are not, you will get tons of help to catch up. He goes really slowly to make sure everyone keeps up, and explains things to death -- you may get bored, but you will learn. Great professor overall. Gives extra credit too.","The fact that he has an A- grade is one of the most absurd things I have ever seen. His grading is the most ridiculous things ever and I truly suggest getting out of this class before you even enroll in it.  Pataki's way or the high way. Also do not let him learn your name because he will constantly call you out in class. AVOID GABOR PATAKI!!!!!!!!","Many homework are fun but tough, the hardness of exam varies a lot among years, and the grading scales are not very clear, so be prepared!  But Prof Pataki is a good guy who is funny and kind to students most of the time. His teaching style is confusing in the beginning, but once you get used to it, the lectures turns out to be easy and clear.","Gabor is a very good professor if you are willing to put in the effort. You can earn a ton of extra credit in class by his funny coupon system. He wants you to learn, and understand math, instead of just memorizing formulas -- this was actually my first math class ever, where I really UNDERSTOOD stuff. He has some quirks, as previously noted.","Basically if you've never taken Calculus before you are finished. Even if you have taken high level statistics classes or a fair amount of high level Math courses he will make you think you know nothing about Math. Worst professor I have ever had.","This is a really easy class, especially if you've taken calculus before (highly recommended). Tests are identical to homework, so redo all of them before the test and its not bad at all. He does grade very strictly, so its good to come to class to learn how he likes things shownexplained. Plus he gives out A TON of extra credit for coming.","Incredibly arbitrary grading. If you know calculus, he will make you think you know nothing even if you aced it before. The way he makes you think makes the math unnecessarily difficult. Even if there is an easier, clearer way of doing something, it is wrong.","If you haven't taken calculus before this class, I suggest doing so as he is not the most clear professor & makes you learn everything the long way, which can be very confusing. The tests are directly from the homework, so as long as you redo them before the exams you should do fine. You don't need to attend class, & he gives out extra credit daily","His class is like being in middle school all over again. You may know how to do calculus, but if you don't show it in \"patakulus\" formatting then you're wrong. Answer right? Half  Credit because you didn't show your work right. Answer Wrong? Most you can expect is half credit IF you do your work right. Beware of this going in.","I took his class because it was required for my major and he was the only professor teaching it. Gabor has a lot of quirks that you'll notice right off the bat but overall he knows his subject really well and is helpful at office hours. Attendance isn't mandatory but I highly encourage it because this class waits for no man.","Very Nice person and and good at explaining concepts. HW are helpful but time consuming.","You will use the textbook for all of the homeworks. I think there were 18 HWS. He drops the lowest (one or two) homeworks. Redo ALL of the hw for the exams and you will make an A in the course. The only reason I made a B+ was bc I didn't redo the hw for the second exam (everyone butchered that one). Overall I  think he is a great teacher.","One will need a fifth of vodka to get through this class; the time spent on pre-calculus in a calculus class is beyond ridiculous. Over half the class was spent doing tedious assignments that must be completed in a very communist-like fashion; Only one way to do it down to the letter. Leaving this class makes one so mad they will see red.","Gabor is very helpful and fair-paced. He goes over every step to ensure clarity. HOWEVER, he has a very unfair extra credit \"coupon system\". He definitely has favorites who get all the coupons, while he ignores the others. Also, it affects final grades so the grading system is not standard at all. These coupons challenge UNC's academic integrity.","Goes very slowly which is good and bad. But all around really nice patient guy who makes sure that you understand what's going on constantly."],"courses":["STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR612","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","612","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
