However, the fun projects weren't worth a semester of boring lectures and reading assignments. Dale is a good teacher, but the just class wasn't for me.","Professor Hutchinson clearly loves his field of study and is very knowledgeable about human origins, but he had a difficult time conveying the information in a helpful way. His powerpoints were very disorganized, and sometimes the information was out of date or did not align with what was in the textbook. I wish there had been more consistency.","Fantastic professor! I took his ANTH 50 class and it was the most enjoyable course I took all semester. His lectures are engaging and always interesting. Not to mention we handled real skeletons! The readings are interesting as well, and are very good books.","416 involves 3 group projects, 1 case study paper, and a final exam, all which are decently graded if done correctly. Also, final exam is given to you and you may bring a 2 page cheat sheet. It definitely comes in handy being familiar with anatomical terms before this course. Interesting course about diseases, the dead, and archaeology","The 3 exams involve a lot of memorization, and reading the novel and textbook is essential in order to do well. Lectures are often confusing, but the textbook may clarify the lecture concepts. There is also a paper, and its requirements are clearly outlined with examples. There are lecture & recitation attendance grades, so always attend class!","I had him as a professor my first semester at UNC and found it very difficult to do well in his class (as compared to all of my other classes). He is very vague during lecture and provides a lot of material without really explaining its relevance. If you do not read the textbook, you will not pass.","lectures were very confusing and i learned everything from the textbook. the exams are all multiple choice consisting of memorization.","This is the most interesting class I have taken in college. Dale looks a lot like an archaeologist and he fits the position perfectly. Tests were difficult for me as a math major: pure memorization and LOTS of it. The average on the midterm was a C-, but the final was easier and he added bonus questions. This class was a lot of work but worth it.","Definitely looks like an anthropologist. This class was hard, a lot of memorizing material to be honest. The field is constantly changing so the material actually changed a little while learning it. Look in the text book for the stuff you don't understand and ask the TAs. Not an easy A, and attendance is mandatory, but it wasn't the worst class.","His class was overall very interesting! At times the course material could get a little boring but he adds in stories and experiences to  liven it up. All you really have to do to get a good grade are go to class and study some for the exams!","Super engaging and enthusiastic professor who, imo, makes lectures very interesting. Tests are all multiple choice, matching, and true/false, which isn't too difficult. You'll watch a lot of film. *Note: He assigns readings in the textbooks for every class, but you never actually use it in class, and only have one paper related to them.","If you don't mind memorizing long lists of fossils, their location, the researchers who found them, the time it was discovered, what soil it was in, etc, etc, etc, then take this class. It really was just tedious memorization, which of course I soon forgot. Hutchinson is nice, but it doesn't make up for the class on the whole.","Best professor ive had so far. very clear, willing to give multiple definitions, examples are very good and help you understand more complex topics, and he looks the part! if u want to take anth take it with him","He's really interesting in the topic, but the material is confusing. There are no hard facts, but the tests are all multiple choice, which makes things confusing. I got two C- on my midterms and still managed to pull out an 88 in the class. He weighs attendance as much as exams so GO TO CLASS!","Most interesting class I've taken at UNC. Professor Hutchinson is extremely approachable and willing to give you all the help you need to understand the material.","Dr. Hutchinson is really excited and enthusiastic about teaching biological anthropology and is extremely helpful if clarification is needed. Although the subject matter can get a little dry at times, he was a pretty engaging teacher and we watched a lot of film.

Super cool!","Reasonably clear lectures, does ramble at times, can be rather boring.  Assigns a lot of reading.  Does not go out of his way to meet students, but will help if you visit his office hours.  Tests are a bit difficult, but he gives extra credit if you attend recitations.  Can be intimidating, but is very fair and reasonable, sometimes funny","Not a very good professor. His lectures are pointless, the textbook and readings are all you need to pass. The only good TA is Eric Thomas, the others are awful and snobby. The lectures are so boring and Price uses vocab he makes off from the top of his head. Plus he makes you buy his own book which is completely irrelevant to the class.","Nice guy but avoid taking him if you can!! I wish I would have read these and taken West instead (who I hear is amazing).  His power points do not make any sense, his test are hard, even when you study and he counts the 2 tests and 1 essay as 90 percent of your grade with no willingness to help if you score badly on one (or both).  AVOID HIM!!!","THE LECTURES ARE VERY INTERESTING. HE MAKES THEM FUN AND IS GENUINELY CONCERNED WITH YOU LEARNING/LIKING THE MATERIAL. HE IS A LITTLE CONFUSING, AND HIS POWERPOINT SLIDES DON'T EXPAND ENOUGH TO TRULY HELP. THE TESTS ARE TOUGH, BUT IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU READ AND RE-READ THEN YOU SHOULD DO FINE.","Dr. Price is a great professor. He is not only passionate about his work, he is also a very nice person. The class was fairly easy and extra credit was offered throughout the semester","Price's lectures are very boring and the tests are unnecessarily hard.  There are so many very long readings that are also very boring.  Would NEVER recommend this class with this professor","There's no point in coming to class. He is confusing and boring and the exams aren't hard but we never learned about anything exciting. His Rastafarian book is horrible and he constantly rants about race.","Typical introductory course. Okay lectures, decent tests, decent textbook. Essays help your grade. To do well, read textbooks and posted readings and review powerpoints.","I dreaded this class. I didnt care about it AT ALL, and that's probs why I came out with a C. After studying my butt off for the first 2 tests and only receiving 80, i started to give up. The tests werent even that hard...it really doesnt make any sense. He never gives the tests back. Gives you extra credit essays, but TAs are sucky graders.","The class was pretty interesting. If you're willing to read all assigned reading thoroughly, you can definitely get an A. Although it's hard not to fall asleep in many lectures, He's very nice and tries to keep students engaged.","Prof. Price is a pretty cool guy.  If you study for his tests, you will do well on them.  STUDY THE ARTICLES, NOT JUST THE BOOK.  He also assigns a book assignment concerning the Rastafari.  Also he gives an option for a huge amount of extra credit.  Plus, the guy has really long dreadlocks.  I got an A in the class, and so can you.","Professor Price is my favorite professor this semester. He is a really cool guy, very down to earth, and I never have a problem staying awake in his class. The lectures are very interesting, as are most of the readings. However, the Rastafarian book was NOT good.","The guy himself is awesome. Real cool outlook, has Rastafarian traits, etc. but he is a complex lecturer...tests are somewhat average if you study. TA's are useless. Didn't take attendance for recitations so I never went. Lectures = boring.","Lectures are boring and hard to follow and take notes. In addition to the textbook, he assigns many additional readings and this long and boring rastafarian book.  However, there is only one paper and it is only 2 pages.  You can also do another paper for extra credit.  Also, all exams are 50 easy multiple choice questions.","I liked the guy, hes a rastafarian guys with 5 ft dreadlocks and i actually found the subject intersting. it changed my outlook on society. never used either book,lost them both. He is hard to follow and is scatterbrained but just show up and take notes on what you can discern from the lectures, you'll be fine. 4 hrs studying prior to test- easy B","ANTH 101 is not Price's forte. He said, on day 1, he hadn't taught 101 in awhile. So I understood the--subpar lectures. BUT, the textbook for 101 is VERY interesting and I would highly recommend taking ANTH 101.  Dr. Price may not be the lecturer for you if you want to be enveloped in class everyday. His class is easy.  I got a B.  Read & study ppt","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  it is terrible, he is SO boring. he rarely uses powerpoint and just gets up there and talks about GOD KNOWS WHAT.  he doesn't really use the book either, so you can't really follow along on your own.  oh, and my TA neither spoke nor understood ANY english...so recitation was a complete and utter waste of my life.","AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!!! Taking this class with Dr. Price will teach you more about racism and the hardships blacks have to endure rather than anything about Anthropology. His lectures are annoying and filled with vocabulary he seemed to create spontaneously. Just don't do it man! Wait to take this course with another teacher!!","He was super boring, hard to follow, and it seemed like he made up the lectures as he went. The class was a waste of my time. TAs are really helpful, though!"],"courses":["ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH10"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"ANTH","catalog_nbr":994,"section":78,"class_nbr":5843,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"THOMPSON,AMANDA LOGAN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":2,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2137078","fname":"Amanda","lname":"Thompson","quality":"3.3","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Respected (2)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GROUP PROJECTS","RESPECTED"],"comments":["Lectures were engaging and interesting.

I had to make myself come to class, and by the end of the semester I wasn't even coming to class except for once a week. Theres no need to go to class though, you can basically just teach yourself everything based on the powerpoint he posts. Wouldn't take a class with him again","Really cool guy and the class itself was interesting.  He tells lots of interesting stories about his personal stories and always tries to make you laugh and keep you engaged in a big lecture.  The only thing that was frustrating was how specific the tests were.  He gives study guides but they are way different from the tests.  random specifics","Really liked this class! Laid-back atmosphere and West tells great stories about his kids and the field work that he's done. The subject matter was interesting and not difficult. Would definitely take a class with him again!","Probably my favorite class b/c of West. He is very passionate about what he does and it's clearly evident. He's done a lot of field work, so class is interesting b/c he'll have \"West story time\" and never fails to make the class laugh. He assigns readings but I never read and have an A. Go to class and look over powerpoints (all the info is there)","Thor West loves his job and that definitely shows in the classroom. As long as you pay attention and go to class tests aren't that hard. He's so passionate about his work and tells so many little relevant stories that it keeps the lectures interesting.  He's such an interesting person and won't fail to make you laugh during class.","Coolest professor. He loves to tell (relevant) stories about his field work and his kids. He expects participation but it's very easy. Awesome class and he knows the topics and readings","West is great! decided to take ANTH 459 b/c I thought it sounded interesting, not thinking it was too high of a level for my year/major. However, it was my highest grade (A)! Not too much work, just a lot of reading. But he sympathizes when the reading is boring, so dont stress about tough ones. Helps a lot to be a naturally strong writer","West is really nice and enthusiastic about the subject matter. Warning: there is a lot of reading to do in the class, but he doesn't give quizzes. Available for help, only 2 papers and a small presentation and a bigger one. Great guy! I recommend him","Dr. West is a terrific professor. I knew nothing about Africa until I took his class. Now I know a lot and want to know more!"],"courses":["ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH238","ANTH459","ANTH459","ANTH238"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
