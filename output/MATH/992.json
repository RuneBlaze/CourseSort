He expects you to be more than proficient with understanding and be very active in reading ahead.  Be ready to program a lot. I worked extremely hard to finish the hw, but those are the majority of your grade.  He can be blunt and condescending and but not necessarily unwarranted.  Text is useful","Prof. Mitran is a very interesting professor, but his lectures are long and sometimes don't cover what you need to know on the homework assignments. Tests are difficult and he doesn't really review for them at all.","Lectures are long, but you have to pay attention or else you will fall behind. Each homework takes about 8 hours so start much earlier. He uses half-functioning virtual machine called Tarheel Linux that you might have to ask ITS to help you install. He uses Octave too. The tests are easy but you have to know the concepts and steps.","Soooo many homework ,  long lecture, better learn those material by yourself","Best professor I have ever had in the math department. He holds high expectations for his students, but his tests are very fair and he is also a fair grader.","Dr. Mitran is undoubtedly a very intelligent individual. However, he fails to clearly communicate many of the ideas he wishes to teach in class, and I learned more reading outside papers on the topics discussed than I did from his lectures or notes. He is also an incredible tough grader and can be very derisive towards questions he feels are inane.","The course is demanding, and he has no interest in holding your hand. He often belittled those who asked questions in class, creating an environment where everyone was afraid to speak up.  Not a nice guy.  That said, he lectures well.  I learned a lot in this class, but I wasn't a rewarding experience.","Mitran's MATH 566 was the most difficult mathematics class of my undergraduate career (BS Math).  Having survived the class though, I can honestly say I learned more from it than from any other.  Mitran is a strict and intimidating professor, but I feel this is a fair trade for the amount of knowledge he tends to impart.","Prof. Mitran will push you and make things difficult, but he's fair and you get a ton out of the class. Highly recommended!!!11!","Lectures were interesting and well motivated. By far the best lecturer I have had. The workload is hard but fair and helpful to learning the material.","Honestly this is by far the worst professor I have ever had","No Comments","No Comments"],"courses":["MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH547","MATH661","MATH566","MATH566","MATH662","MATH662","MATH529","MATH529","MATH81"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
