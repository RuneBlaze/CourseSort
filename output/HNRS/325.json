Two short papers and a 10 page final, in addition to daily journals on the readings (not bad at all). Would recommend his FYS!","He is a great professor and very dedicated to Shakespeare. Quizzes and journals are easy grades, and the paper and final exam are simple. Especially good professor to take for Maymester.","Had really boring lectures but he was very passionate about his work.  easy a- on the class paper, had quiz or journal EVERY day during this summer session class but sparknotes will get you a 100 on all of em.","Although he is a nice person, he does not know how to cater to the needs of tired college students. I had a freshman honors seminar with him, and he treated it like a lecture, so there was minimal discussion. His answers to simple student questions would typically take 10-15 minutes. This was one of the most boring classes. Most people slept.","Extremely knowledgeable, highly recommended.","he's very enthusiastic about the subject, so you've got a lotta respect for him.  cheery, nice guy in general.  i would recommend his class.","Challenging, but an excellent professor. He puts Shakespeare into context. Interacts w/ students and very helpful during exam time. Definitely take this course!!","Nothing negative to say about Kendall as a professor. However, he was truly awful as an academic advisor. Once tried to discuss academic/career goals with him -- he looked me in the eye and said, &quot;I really don't care.&quot;","Richie is a great professor!  He was recommended to me by two friends, and after taking him, I'm recommending him to even more people. :)","No Comments"],"courses":["ENG85H","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENGL135H","ENGL29H","ENGL29H","ENGL58","ADVISOR","ENGL5845","ENGL58"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
