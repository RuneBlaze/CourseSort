I have never seen a jazz band director make the music so boring. It's as if he wants to prove to the faculty that he's \"cool\" rather than really trying to teach music to the students or trying to get the jazz band to play with emotion, soul or excitement.","Hes a nice guy as long as your soul continues to be sold to the music department, or at least as a trumpet professor. If you are a music major, and then change majors, your rapport with him will likely change for the far worse, . He is a great Jazz band director, and very helpful and adept in his field, just be wary of where your priorities lie."],"courses":["JAZZBAND","MUSIC213"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD"]}}]
