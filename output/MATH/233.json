However, we did not have access to him. He was gone for two of the exams and the entire week prior to the exams, so we could not meet with him to go over the stuff we did not understand...","We had group quizzes very often, but the questions are usually out of the textbook with odd answers in the back. He would explain the process, do a couple practice problems, then move on. We had homework regularly as practice. Test questions were usually straight out of the book, so I suggest doing the review problems to study. Want to take again.","Assani's 521 class was definitely one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, but Assani was able to make it much more manageable than I would have expected. He is a somewhat lenient grader with a great final curve, which helped make sure I didn't actually fail the class. I'd definitely recommend him to anyone looking to learn a class.","This class is like any advanced math class; it's hard. Prof. Assani really knows what he is talking about, but can breeze pass difficult topics. Tests are TOUGH. Don't get discouraged if you completely bomb one. I got a 37% on my first midterm, but studied HARD for the other tests and did fine. No initial curve; there's a final curve at the end.","Dr. Assani is by far my favorite math professor I've had at UNC. His lectures  move quickly, but he explains everything very logically so that if you keep up with the reading, its easy to make sense of all the concepts. The hardest part is applying these concepts on his exams, but theyre almost all like the textbookin class problems.","Professor Assani did not answer any student emails to see him outside of his office hours. He hired a T.A. who did not show up to recitation. He would ask for questions and then not wait for any questions. What is worse, he would ignore and even get annoyed with students who really did not understand the material. Overall, he was not helpful.","Dr. Assani is amazing.  He is way more concerned about his students than the average professor -- he will go out of his way to help you and has a strong interest in the success of his undergraduate students.  Totally my favorite teacher of all time.","I had Assani for Linear Algebra (not Calculus, as some of the other reviewers have).  He was great in my class.  He did go a little fast, but he was excellent in conveying &quot;the big picture&quot;.  He (rightly) expected you to work, but graded fairly and *did* give partial credit.  Not a perfect teacher (those are rare) but I would still recommend him.","Exams are extremely hard and unpredictable. I recommend doing all problems in the textbook for each section because he chooses random ones to be on the exam.","Before taking this class I loved calculus. It was so frustrating taking his tests because they were nothing like the homework assignments or the problems in the book. That isn't even the worst of it. He doesn't give partial credit although he says he does. You could spend 20 minutes working one test problem and make a small mistake towards the end","After every class, I'd feel that I've gotten a very thorough lesson and that it was worth my time - quite substantial. He certainly doesn't waste time in class. He teaches on a slightly quick and advanced pace. He is fair with tests. He is my favorite math teacher here and I highly recommend him to others."],"courses":["MATH233","MATH233","COMP521","MATH233","MATH521","MATH521","MATH521","MATH147","CALC233","MATH233","MATH"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":233,"section":9,"class_nbr":2203,"title":"MULTI VARI CALC I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0385","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"VARCHENKO,ALEXANDER","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QI"],"enrl_cap":42,"enrl_tot":42,"wait_cap":15,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1471401","fname":"Alexander","lname":"Varchenko","quality":"3.0","easiness":"1.0","help":"1.0","clarity":"1.0","topTag":"","grade":"1.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["Really easy online tests with lots of attempts."],"courses":["MATH233"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":233,"section":3,"class_nbr":2197,"title":"MULTI VARI CALC I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0385","days":"MWF","time":"09","instructor":"ETHERIDGE,DEBRA L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QI"],"enrl_cap":42,"enrl_tot":42,"wait_cap":15,"wait_tot":4,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=329761","fname":"Debra","lname":"Etheridge","quality":"2.9","easiness":"3.5","help":"3.5","clarity":"3.5","topTag":"Tough Grader (11)","grade":"3.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","TOUGH GRADER","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","SKIP CLASS?

You just have to ask! Yes she is a little crazy about notation, but her tests aren't bad. Read up, do the hw, you'll be FINE","Not a terrible teacher but tests were extremely difficult. Do not take this class with her - take it with a TA or another professor.  She is mean and hard to approach. She told me she had a PhD in math, not teaching. Also probably one of the toughest graders at UNC. BEWARE","Dr. Etheridge gave helpful resources like online courses and online notes as we read the textbook ourselves such that we knew the points of each chapter and acquired knowledge beyond the textbook. She also provided useful instructions for your studying habits. What I gained in her class helped me quickly adjusted to higher-level classes this term","Dr. Etheridge used a form of flipped class so students could learn the materials in their own paces. Additionally, she gave time for students to ask questions about reading before she began classes, and the lecture was efficiently used to practice problems on respective knowledge. She was humorous, encouraging and helpful when answering questions.","I like flipped classes but all she did was throw a textbook at us and tell us to read. No lecture, no walking through concepts just read just her doing problems in front of the class with little explanation. Every time someone asked a question, she let out a long sigh before answering. She does not hand out partial credit and her tests are awful.","Flipped classroom setting so expect to teach yourself the ENTIRE course. She grades horrifically on tests and took off points for any extra work on the test that she deemed unnecessary. A lot of the work done in class is directly from previous homework. If you like teachers that teach you, pick someone else.","Dr. Etheridge is really quirky, but very nice. She has a flipped classroom, so most of the teaching falls upon the student. She is very helpful in office hours if you go to them. Her tests are not impossible, but the final was pretty tough. I would recommend Math 233 with someone else if you do not like the flipped classroom setting.","Etheridge is the most harshest grader I've had and sometimes fumbles around her thoughts while trying to explain a student a concept. She doesn't care for the students mastery of a concept before you have to self-teach the next one.  Also there's no curve. This class will wreck your GPA.","At first she is not very friendly but as the semester goes on she makes more jokes and laughs. She is one of the hardest math professors but also very helpful. She was always open to questions in class. Expect points off for minor things but also expect to actually learn the material. Read the syllabus thoroughly because she gets mad if you don't.","Dr. Etheridge comes across a little bit cold at first, but she warms up as the semester progresses. Don't be scared to ask her questions, because she will answer them, and you will better understand the concepts. Very helpful at office hours. Also, watch the Cenegage videos in the online textbook for reinforcement.. very helpful.","If you HAVE to take Calc 2 avoid her","She's a very nice person but she doesn't teach in class, and all the work you do does not match the material on the test","The tests are impossible, and she barely explains anything in class.  The classroom is flipped which makes learning more difficult.  I lived at the Math Help Center because I was learning nothing in class. Her grading is rough.  Takes off points for notation errors.","She is the worst teacher ever and grades test so hard. Taking her class was the biggest mistake I made","She did a flip classroom setup, so you had to teach yourself. Then she would go over 2 examples, not very clearly. When you went to office hours she ACTUALLY could teach but in class it's a waste of time. The test were pretty rough, she takes off for the littlest of things.","The learning method is innovative: read the textbook, watch the tutorial videos, and do the preview questions before attending sessions.","Dr. Etheridge is extremely helpful if you put in the effort.  Her office hours are best to see.  Willing to go over things until you get them.  Tests aren't horrible; but u have to study the material to even think about getting a good score.","Etheridge is a poor professor. I came into calc 3 with high B's In calc 1 & 2 in high school & a 5 on the AP BC exam. Her tests aren't the most difficult things, but she takes off points for the dumbest notation errors even if you have the right answers. Her teaching is erratic, and often very poor. I taught myself this class. Avoid if possible","She's probably the hardest grader I've ever encountered at UNC.  Over the course I missed 1 part of a problem on a test yet I still wound up with an 88 in the class; she takes off points for things like \"you dropped a vector sign in your work\" or \"didn't write cm^3\" on your work, regardless of whether or not you produce the correct answer.","She is very enthusiastic about the course, and answers questions when asked.

Her tests are almost all based on questions shown in class or homework. She was always willing to take her time to explain something to any one student even if it took the whole class block. Overall, caring and rather straightforward tests. Webassigns took a fair amount of time though.","McLaughlin takes her time in lectures and provides plenty of examples to make sure you understand the material. The examples are much harder than the tests, so if you can do those then the tests won't be bad. There is homework twice a week, but aside from that its not a terribly demanding class. I feel like a learned a lot from McLaughlin.","She keeps it real and tries to put you in the best position to get good scores in the exam. She could be better with explaining sometimes. Take good notes in class because the problems she works on the board are likely to show up in one of the three midterms. Shes say it as it is and will usually give obvious hints for pop quizes.","Professor McLaughlin was oddly lax every time I reached out for help after receiving a not-so-great grade and just told me not to worry about it which was pretty frustrating. Unless you REALLY go out of your way to make yourself known to her (i.e. going to office hours, going up to the board, etc.) don't expect much help from the professor.","McLaughlin is a nice woman. However, she moves really fast and she doesn't clarify very well. It is extremely hard if you've never been exposed to Calculus concepts before. Tons of Webassign homework. Three hard midterms. Final can replace one of them. The important thing is to have a good recitation leader; they can really help you understand.","Lectures are her explaining and working out problems. Sometimes quizzes are given in recitation but its just more working out problems. Doesn't give partial credit. Claims you need to read the book in order to pass the test. Personally, not true. Read it once and it wasn't much help. Web Assign takes a very long time to finish. Tests are a bit hard","Terrible writing on the blackboard. She teaches really fast sometimes makes me confused.","she expects you to know a lot of stuff  prior to taking her class","I took calculus in high school and came in with a pretty good understanding. Somehow, through the course of the semester, I actually became more confused than I have ever been before. McLaughlin took the material I thought I knew, and explaining it in the worst way possible, managed to un-teach me all of it.","WebAssign is easy and helpful if you put in the time. She is willing to help if you come to class. Tests are very fair--more so than other calculus professors. Taking her for 232 next semester and would recommend. Class is a breeze if you had Calculus in high school.","While she is probably the easiest Math 231 professor, she's also the worst professor. Do not take McLaughlin if you have no calc background because she won't help much. She's confusing and does random example problems without explaining the concepts. This is the only class where my recitation actually helped because I had no idea what was going on.","Do not take math 231 with this professor.  She is very scatterbrained and her class is impossible. I got an A in AP Calc in high school and math was my strongest subject before now. I didn't get above a 54 on any test, including the final this year.","One of those math professors that, when doing practice problems, does not know how to explain what she is doing and why she is doing it.  Likes to skip steps when solving.  test avg has never been over 53. If you like math, don't take her because she can't teach you anything; if you don't like math, don't take her because you will fail her class.","I don't know if I am missing something with all of these previous ratings, but I am currently failing calculus and I have attended every class and have lived in office hours, relying on my TA to teach me the stuff she never taught us yet tests us on. She goes way too fast and expects us to already know everything, and her tests are HARSHY graded!","She is terrible. Very scatterbrained and flaky, and not good at explaining anything. The only good thing about my class is that I have an excellent TA, but it sucks that he's basically teaching us everything because she's so bad at her job. I don't know how I will pass this class. Avoid her at all costs unless you like being confused.","Not really a math person but I absolutely loved  McLaughlin. She was incredibly clear during lectures and made the material very easy to understand. The WebAssign is usually hard, but the answers can be found online and in the book. The problems on the exam are much easier and if you know the class examples and homework, its easy to make an A or A-","She goes pretty fast. Although very intelligent, not prepared for class at times. She did a whole problem on the board and never solved it. She changes homework dates a few times which sometimes doesn't help.","She is pretty clear in explaining her expectations, helpful and inspirational. Homework is lot more harder than test themselves but if you attend lectures and do homework properly than you should be fine with all her tests. I would definitely recommend taking her!","Excellent teacher. If you have to take calc I definitely recommend her.","McLaughlin is one of my favorite professors: she is extremely clear and is quite nice. Her tests are 'easy', but she gives no partial credit for your answers even if you make the smallest mistake, so averages are in the 60s.

Absolutely love her!","Greatest class ever. I legitimately showed up to half the classes and I'm about to pull a 95+.

I came into calc 3 with high B's In calc 1 & 2 in high school & a 5 on the AP BC exam. Her tests aren't the most difficult things, but she takes off points for the dumbest notation errors even if you have the right answers. Her teaching is erratic, and often very poor. I taught myself this class. Avoid if possible","She's probably the hardest grader I've ever encountered at UNC.  Over the course I missed 1 part of a problem on a test yet I still wound up with an 88 in the class; she takes off points for things like \"you dropped a vector sign in your work\" or \"didn't write cm^3\" on your work, regardless of whether or not you produce the correct answer.","She is very enthusiastic about the course, and answers questions when asked. Don't hesitate to ask!

You just have to ask! Yes she is a little crazy about notation, but her tests aren't bad. Read up, do the hw, you'll be FINE","Not a terrible teacher but tests were extremely difficult. Do not take this class with her - take it with a TA or another professor.  She is mean and hard to approach. She told me she had a PhD in math, not teaching. Also probably one of the toughest graders at UNC. BEWARE","Dr. Etheridge gave helpful resources like online courses and online notes as we read the textbook ourselves such that we knew the points of each chapter and acquired knowledge beyond the textbook. She also provided useful instructions for your studying habits. What I gained in her class helped me quickly adjusted to higher-level classes this term","Dr. Etheridge used a form of flipped class so students could learn the materials in their own paces. Additionally, she gave time for students to ask questions about reading before she began classes, and the lecture was efficiently used to practice problems on respective knowledge. She was humorous, encouraging and helpful when answering questions.","I like flipped classes but all she did was throw a textbook at us and tell us to read. No lecture, no walking through concepts just read just her doing problems in front of the class with little explanation. Every time someone asked a question, she let out a long sigh before answering. She does not hand out partial credit and her tests are awful.","Flipped classroom setting so expect to teach yourself the ENTIRE course. She grades horrifically on tests and took off points for any extra work on the test that she deemed unnecessary. A lot of the work done in class is directly from previous homework. If you like teachers that teach you, pick someone else.","Dr. Etheridge is really quirky, but very nice. She has a flipped classroom, so most of the teaching falls upon the student. She is very helpful in office hours if you go to them. Her tests are not impossible, but the final was pretty tough. I would recommend Math 233 with someone else if you do not like the flipped classroom setting.","Etheridge is the most harshest grader I've had and sometimes fumbles around her thoughts while trying to explain a student a concept. She doesn't care for the students mastery of a concept before you have to self-teach the next one.  Also there's no curve. This class will wreck your GPA.","At first she is not very friendly but as the semester goes on she makes more jokes and laughs. She is one of the hardest math professors but also very helpful. She was always open to questions in class. Expect points off for minor things but also expect to actually learn the material. Read the syllabus thoroughly because she gets mad if you don't.","Dr. Etheridge comes across a little bit cold at first, but she warms up as the semester progresses. Don't be scared to ask her questions, because she will answer them, and you will better understand the concepts. Very helpful at office hours. Also, watch the Cenegage videos in the online textbook for reinforcement.. very helpful.","If you HAVE to take Calc 2 avoid her","She's a very nice person but she doesn't teach in class, and all the work you do does not match the material on the test","The tests are impossible, and she barely explains anything in class.  The classroom is flipped which makes learning more difficult.  I lived at the Math Help Center because I was learning nothing in class. Her grading is rough.  Takes off points for notation errors.","She is the worst teacher ever and grades test so hard. Taking her class was the biggest mistake I made","She did a flip classroom setup, so you had to teach yourself. Then she would go over 2 examples, not very clearly. When you went to office hours she ACTUALLY could teach but in class it's a waste of time. The test were pretty rough, she takes off for the littlest of things.","The learning method is innovative: read the textbook, watch the tutorial videos, and do the preview questions before attending sessions.","Dr. Etheridge is extremely helpful if you put in the effort.  Her office hours are best to see.  Willing to go over things until you get them.
