He was extremely helpful and available outside of class. He was only harsh a couple of times in the class, but for well-explained reasons and the students ended up improving for it. A delight from whom to learn.","Class was boring but that could've been because the majority of the class wasn't enthusiastic. He didn't offer me very much criticism so either my poems were nearly perfect or he else he just wasn't helpful. I liked the writing assignments and the readings though. The class got me excited about poetry but that had little to do with him as a prof.","A great professor. He might get tired of you as a person, fast, and end up hurting your feelings, but that doesn't change the fact that--he's a great professor, helpful and kind on a professional lvl.","He may be a &quot;brilliant&quot; writer, but he was very unhelpful as a writing workshop teacher years ago at UNCG. Candor is one thing, but he was downright discouraging. A writing teacher should provide helpful comments to guide a writer toward a more profitable path. Fortunately I was able to surmount his comments and thrive as a scribe.","My favorite professor at UNC. He is a brilliant writer and really well-respected around the country. Definitely take the opportunity to take a class with him.","A good intro poetry writing professor. Lots of students have trouble with the meter, since he tecahes it somewhat quickly, but just ask for help if you need it.","Brilliant writer and gives excellent feedback to students. He doesn't hesitate to tell you when something sucks but he always speaks the truth. Great rapport with students--he has been my favorite professor here."],"courses":["ADVPOET","ENGL131","ENGL120","ENG300","POETRY","ENGL20W","ENG34P"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
