She's funny (sometimes unintentionally so) and she's pretty relatable as a human being. Sometimes she's tough on grading, but if you have some kind of extenuating circumstance she will gladly work with you to figure things out.","I LOVE PROFE DE FAYS!! she is absolutely HILARIOUS and truly cares about you! i have had some attendance issues because of things going on outside of class, and she really is understanding and works to meet you halfway. she does give points for partipation everyday, so it is important to raise your hand. she is great if you truly want to learn span","Profesora de Fays is really funny and engaging in a small (20) class; she makes jokes and can tell when we're bored. She really wants participation and you get daily points for it. She was available for help and very forgiving if you attend class and engage. Importance of readings is inversely related to how well you understand her spoken Spanish.","I personally didn't like her. When we did presentations, I spoke fluently and with a pretty good accent (I've taken Spanish since 2nd grade) but I'd always get a B or a B+; yet, the girl with a pretty bad accent and constant pauses gets an A...","Excellent teacher. She is knowledgeable, approachable and reliable. She respects her students and encourages them. You have to work hard and cover a lot of material. She brings it all together with a sophisticated, cosmopolitan sensibility.","Super nice and approachable. The class can get boring at times, but she does her best to keep it interesting and keep students engaged. It's also pretty much a guaranteed A or B if you do the reading and study for the quizzes.","I took Spanish 101 last semester, and, while being very likeable, it seemed like she was impatient/uninterested with teaching us beginners new material. She covered subjects too fast and did not seem sympathetic to beginner problems. She was very funny and pleasant to be in class with, though, and i ended with a B+ in the class.","Very friendly and easy going person.  330 covered a little too much (ancient times through 1917), but was extremely interesting.","One word, boring. Had a big lecture class with her. Easy though.","She keeps the class interesting and definitely has a sense of humor.  Her class isn't the easiest but as long as you pay attention and ask questions, it turns out fine.  She is a great person in general!"],"courses":["SPAN331","SPAN204","SPAN331","SPAN204","SPAN330","SPAN330","SPAN101","SPAN330","SPAN330","SPAN203"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
