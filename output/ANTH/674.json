She is on the forefront today of the work she teaches. She will fly to belize one day, mexico the next week, and brussels two weeks later. Really knowledgeable and her lectures are interesting. She engages well and you know what she is expecting.","This class was maybe the easiest I've ever had. If you actually review the material, take decent notes, you are almost guaranteed an A. People who complain are those who don't do those things, but it's really so easy if you just do those simple things. Easiest class and filled a Gen Ed too!","Please don't take this class. Just save yourself the annoyance and go ahead and take this off your schedule for this year. She is seriously the most patronizing woman ever. Her material is absolutely pointless and she seems utterly unprepared for every lecture. Just terrible.","This class was supposed to be easy, but instead it is really boring. The professor is a cool lady, but extremely monotone. The material is not very interesting either, and the tests are kind of difficult. The teacher gives extra credit though, which can save your butt!","I was an ANTH major for a while, so I took this class to fulfill a requirement.  If you're an Anth major and understand how anthropology professors operate then you're golden.  If not, then ask for help! She can seem rude sometimes but she's actually very helpful.  She likes it when people put in a clear effort, that's all.  Two papers, two exams.","I thought the class was extremely easy. If you're looking for a great way to fulfill a VP requirement, take this class. As long as you review your notes prior to taking any kind of exam and you go to class, you will get a good grade. Attendance was never taken during lecture, however it is taken during recitation. Recitations are every other week.","Exams are all different and she makes no effort to prepare the class for them. Often rude to students and class has no overall perceivable objective/direction. Would not recommend taking this class from her.","The powerpoints were really unorganized. She doesn't post the slides afterwards, so you better have a photographic memory. Good luck.","Occasionally takes attendance. Helpful teacher, but a bit tough. Group work was required for class. Mostly powerpoint lectures, but she's very engaging."],"courses":["ANTH232","ANTH123","ANTH123","ANTH123","ANTH232","ANTH123","ANTHR123","ANTH123","ANTH232"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
