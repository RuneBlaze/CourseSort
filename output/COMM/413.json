YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["Cante is not a professor for you if you are a typical millennial college student and want your hand held. His lectures take you to a new dimension of engagement with the material that if you give it an honest effort it begins to take shape and become clear. This class is an easy A if you write down profound things he says and apply it to material.","Fascinating material.","One of the best professors at Carolina.","Rich Cante is a BRILLIANT Professor!  And, yes, he can read notes on a napkin and still provide you with the theoretical base that you need in the academy and beyond.  If you are a REAL intellectual you will love, respect and appreciate Cante!","Utterly terrible.  It's frustrating that he is obviously brilliant, yet he doesn't structure any of his lectures.  He rants and raves and takes joy in leaving his class a confused mess.  Worst teacher at Chapel Hill.","Really boring, doesn't make sense, and won't take questions in class","No Comments","just talk to him.  can seem intimidting in class, but is a really nice guy who cres greatly about his students.","Loved the class.  Which he had more personality and was less obtrusive and monotone.  Overall learned a lot.","No Comments","No Comments","Rich rules and he is hilarious.  One of the few profs who tells it like it is.  He is brilliant.","Demanding, but interesting, clear and funny (in a dry sort of way).  Doesn't hurt that he's very cute!","Excellent.  He's very excited by ideas and very original.  Just make sure you keep up with the reading, or you will be *****d.  Also, if you do badly on the midterm just really improve a lot on the final paper and he'll give you a high class grade anyway.","Cante is by far the best prof in Comm. He's hard but totally fair and cool.","No Comments","Cante MEANS BUSINESS.  But he also has a real sense of humor.  Great prof for serious students looking for offbeat classes."],"courses":["COMM413","413","413","COMM548","COMM550","IDST256","COMM411","COMM659","COMM227","THESCENE","THESCENE","COMM","COMM159","COMM159","111","COMM41","COMM41111"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
