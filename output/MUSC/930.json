Her lectures are a masterclass in teaching and she packs so much into class. She sings, makes you sing, plays the piano, and the class is super-interactive.. sometimes too much because she knows when you are not paying attention and WILL call you out. So pay attention! Just stay engaged and you will love her class.","Class is well structured and paced. Big help in this kind of class. She is not an approachable professor if you ask me (once told me to just look it up in the book, then she felt guilty and helped me in person a few minutes later). Just ask TAs for help. She nitpicks on grading given the subject matter but you get used to it. Not a terrible choice.","Professor Neal has a pretty consistent style of teaching through lectures and class engagement, but she can be pretty intimidating to speak to and likes to prove that she knows her stuff. I found a great interest in the class (far more than I thought I was going to) and really loved the material, but you do have to put in work to get a good grade.","Great teacher and very knowledgeable, but assumes music is all you do. As a non-major, this class took up far too much of my time.","I took this class online, and communication was not Neal's strength. She would take weeks to return my email, despite what the syllabus says. Did not give helpful feedback on the papers. She was also late to put up the final. For weekly discussion posts, I have gotten feedback on 1/16 posts. Do not take this class.","Jocelyn is very passionate about country music and is an expert in the field. However, she expects you to be just as passionate and knowledgable. I studied hard for the testsquizzes and still struggled. Some of the info she expects you to know is juts unreasonable.","Master of her field; Prof. Neal brings a lot of excitement to the class but expects everyone to be just as energetic about Country Music. The class has a lot of busy work and the exam is four parts.","Dr. Neal is an amazing professor. Music 333  Popular Music Analysis. This course was difficult and had a lot of reading. She treated us like graduate students  future musicologists so she definitely expected a lot from us and truly cared about our learning. She is an absolute genius and you will learn a lot from her if you work hard!","Dr. Neal is hands down the worst prof I've had at Carolina. She is not understanding when students are sick and she is quite cocky. Her lectures are haphazard at best and her quizzes are much harder than they need to be. I've studied more than I have for other classes for her quizzes and still never managed to get above an 85. AVOID THIS CLASS!!!!!","AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!! Jocelyn is boring, a pain to deal with, and grades inconsistently. The quizzes are impossible and I put in more work for this class than classes for my major to still get a bad grade. I would only recommend this for music majors.","Do not take this class unless you are a country music expert. Expectations and workload are ridiculous for a 100 level class. Prof Neal is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject BUT she makes the class suck because it is so hard.  Do not take if you want to get an A","DON'T TAKE MUSIC 144. Biggest regret. She takes this stuff way too seriously unless you are a music major, you will fail. She plays recordings and expects you to know the insturments being used. I hate this class with a passion.","Does not prepare you well for what she expects you to know. Unrealistic expectations. Very condescending and passive/aggressive. Expects her students to know all the intricacies of music like she does. That being said, she is very passionate about her subject, however pointless it may be.","Dr. Neal was awesome. She taught us so much in a short amount of time, and she is truly an expert in her field. I've never met a theory teacher so intelligent. Although she comes off a little scary at first, as she calls on random people, we all realized that she is really caring and just making sure that we are all getting a great education!","Dr. Neal is amazing!  Super clear lectures, and she knows more about the topic than just about anybody.  Class is actually interesting almost every day.  Tests aren't easy, but they are totally fair.  TAs are good, too.  And in office hours, Dr. Neal will explain almost anything and help you with your papers, too.  Awesome prof!","Seriously one of the best professors I've had at Carolina! She's very passionate about the subject matter and tries to make a music history class as active and interesting as possible. She has high standards but is always available and really nice. I loved having her!","I really loved this class.  It was work, but it wasn't hard.  Basically just a lot of memorizing dates.  There is only a little bit of writing, and in my opinion, they do not grade very difficultly.  I was told that an entire paragraph of my final paper was unnecessary and still ended up getting an A on the paper.","Please please do NOT think that this is a cake class! I made that mistake and it backfired on me. I am a Music minor and these tests KILLED me because you have to know so many dates. Other than that, she is a great professor...pretty much a genious in her field","Neal is a great teacher!  Class was the best preparation for the rest of my music degree ever.  Not the easiest grader, but definitely the best professor in the department.","Worst person ever.  She doesn't care about her students and even though she knows her stuff, she doesn't care to help you at all!"],"courses":["MUSC131","MUSC131","MUSC144","MUSC132","MUSC144","MUSC144","MUSC144","MUSIC333","MUSC144","MUSC144","MUSIC144","MUSC144","MUSC144","MUSC132","MUSC144","MUSIC144","MUSC144","MUSC144","MUSC131","MUSC132"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWFUL"]}}]
