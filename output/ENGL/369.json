YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["Personally, I found this class to be one of my favorites I've taken at UNC.  We read some really great material; and he goes over it in class.  Attendance is mandatory, but participation is not so it's okay to skip some readings.  Class is very chill, kinda boring sometimes, but really great discussion balances that out.  Highly recommend.","There's four grades in the class: midterm, final, semester-long essay, and attendance. He takes roll every time. Lectures SUPER boring. I've fallen asleep in class 3 times and I've never done that before. Easy class, though. Just show up and read the materials. I didn't read any of the novels (only the short stories) and got a B- still.","Strange person.  He puts on this semi-buffoonish shtick at times to sort of act dumb, and he dances around with these verbal shuffles of &quot;ah.. well, ah...&quot; like he doesn't know what he's really saying.  But when he's reading an emotional passage or telling it straight, you can just tell that he's a really deep guy.  Recommended for English majors.","Extremely dull professor whose lectures are little more than re-reading sections of the novel.  The course is a joke, and he offers little insight into the novels.  The exams are both split between character and quotations identifications and a very broad essay.  Read the novels and you do fine, but do not expect to gain anything from the class.","he enjoys prepared students who participate in class. if you have a question for him, go to office hours. make sure you have given the answer some thought before you go becuause he can tell if you don't.","It's amazing that this guy is teaching English when he barely speaks it. Often used words in the wrong context and even made up words (see: thematisizes). I would find his ignorance amusing if I wasn't tortured by his incredibly boring lectures.","great teacher. passionate about the works. Teaches with clarity and provides valuable insight.","I took him for two classes because for some reason I thought that he was less boring than my other English professors.  I'm not sure that I think that he really reads the papers.  It seems like everyone pretty much got the grade that they made on their midterm as their final grade.  He can be funny however act a little elitist.","Hideously boring professor. Is willing to read drafts of intro paragraphs only when you're preparing the course paper. However, he did seem to grade fairly easily.","No Comments","This class was as exciting as watching paint dry.","He's clearly not very smart, but compensates for this deficit with sheer arrogance.  Rude, rude, rude.","oh yuck! so i'm pretty sure he curves considering i came out with a B- and i completely bombed the final and got a C on the midterm but i would rather smash my hand in a car door than sit through another one of his classes.. he takes attendance and i can understand why b/c no one would be there if he didn't! booooring and hard","Very disappointing. Takes potentially enthralling material and makes it unbearably dull. Lectures were disjointed, confusing, and incredibly boring (and he takes attendance!). He is unclear about his expectations but grades harshly.","I thought Coleman was going to be a great prof, but he ended up being the most boring lecturer and a harsh grader. Although I made a C+ on the midterm, I ended up with an A- in the class. If you can hang in there and get through the boring lectures (he takes attendence) then you might end up with a good grade."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL129","ENGL345","ENGL369","ENGL369","ENGL368","ENGL369","ENGL085","ENGL82","ENGL845","ENGL82","ENGL","ENGL22","ENGL85","ENGL82"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}}]
