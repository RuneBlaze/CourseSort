She really cares about students and is very helpful if you go to her office hours.  She ends class early for homework questions and gives concise answers to questions. Tests are easy - definitely do the practice tests, and she allows a 1-page formula sheet. I definitely recommend her class.","Dr. Miller is an awesome prof!"],"courses":["MATH231","MATHCALC"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
