He saved me in calculus. Whenever I needed help, he was there. His lectures are long and tend to put you to sleep, but if you can stay awake through them, you'll understand how thorough and well put together they are.","Sawon is brilliant and helpful, very clear but class moves quickly so pay attention. also, do the effing homework - annoying but worth it! class is longest ever but passable without always attending lecture. overall good professor - and an aussie! ;D","Sawon was not a difficult teacher, easy B if you pay attention in class and easy A if you have taken calculus before. (You will still need to pay attention in class). Attendance is basically optional, so it is harder to pay attention in class than it sounds.","Sawon is clear throughout lectures and always asks if anyone has questions. He does a great job at explaining concepts and taking his time. Homework is online, which is really annoying, but it is doable. The tests get progressively harder but are also doable. Dont really need the textbook, just the webassign code.","Quiet, mild-mannered, math-magician. Intelligent, but a really nice guy if you get to know him well enough. Go to class, and try to stay awake. If you have trouble with web-assign, speak up in a recitation. Sawon loves to help, often with a quiet joke a soft smirk. A mystery, worth getting to know better.","You don't have to show up to class which is nice. 2 tests are fair, one sucks for the midterms. Trust me, you don't need to understand the Web Assigns. Just do them by whatever means necessary and don't take them lightly. This curve needs to be huge though, I'm anxiously waiting to see how nice it is.","Very clear in his examples, willing to answer questions, and discuss any problems during office hours. He assigns homework based on the material covered during class, and every now and then will throw a curveball. He uses webassign, which isn't the most user-friendly website, but the problems are relevant to the test. He has an Australian accent.","Sawon is very clear in his examples, and will answer any questions.  Also, he is very helpful in office hours.  He also has a British accent."],"courses":["MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","231","MATH233"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
