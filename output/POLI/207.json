There are 2 papers. He is willing to greatly help you at office hours with questions you may have and he gives great feedback on rough draft papers.  Must take class.","Steven is super nice and since the class is smaller than the average giant lecture he engages with students a lot. He clearly knows what he is talking about and gives excellent real-world applications to help students understand abstract concepts. He is also an amazingly fast grader. If you pay attention in class the tests will be easy breezy.","Mr. Sparks is a long winded in lecturer.  Sometimes he's curt when you ask him a question, and other times friendly.  Although he shows videos to break up the monotony, it's difficult to make all of to the poli 101 material interesting.  The class wasn't a bad experience and I learned new things,  but I wouldn't take a course with him again.","POLI 101 with Steven was a great experience. He definitely knows what he's talking about and is very passionate about educating. I know that it's a required course for journalism majors, so take it with Steven. He's super helpful and also around during office hours which is a major plus. And his lectures are clear and understandable.","Sparks is super cool and he knows what he is talking about. He's a young guy so maybe that is why I thought it was easier to listen to him- he seemed more relateable. He's good at giving real world examples of complex concepts to help you understand. And his office hours are super helpful- he helps out with essays a ton. Overall I loved this class."],"courses":["POLI101","POLI101","POLI101","POLI101","POLI101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
