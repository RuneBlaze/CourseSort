Pay attention in class and make sure you understand things conceptually, not just on the surface. The tests are pretty short so each problem ways a lot which was kind of intimidating.","Nice person, not the best teacher","MSA is by far my favorite professor this semester. Her lectures are extremely engaging and she very clearly shows that she wants us to learn the material. The homework/midterms are tough because of the format (10 MC + long form), but I feel that I have learned a lot from her class, beyond just memorization and regurgitation, but actual application.","Dr. Sheran-Andrews is extremely organized and passionate about Economics. She makes the class more difficult than it needs to be (the homeworks) but rewards you later with relatively easy tests and midterms. The recitations are optional and helpful about 50% of the time. The Besanko problems are very helpful for the homeworks and the tests.","Excellent teacher. Knows her stuff and cares about it, along with her students.  But beware: if econ does not come naturally to you, you will have to work. A lot. Multiple choice questions are hard and account for half of each test (missing two brings you down a full letter grade). But overall she's an effective teacher despite harsh grading.","This is one of my favorite classes I've taken because the professor is great at teaching. Every word she says is important, so pay attention in class. She's strict and intimidating, but gives you the tools to be successful. She is very knowledgable and is great at breaking down concepts. The exams and homework are tough, but I've learned so much!","Dr. Sheran-Andrews is one of the best professors I've ever had.  She makes what could be dry material interesting and is always willing to explain a concept further if it doesn't make sense. Lectures are interesting and crystal clear. Tests are tough but not impossible.  She's also really funny! Take her class and you won't regret it!","Econ 410 with Sheran-Andrews was okay. She's decent at explaining material and her exams aren't impossible, but I wouldn't take a class with her again. Her office hours are very unhelpful and she doesn't provide much individual feedback. I wouldn't recommend her, but it's not the end of the world if you end up in her class.","Hardest class I've ever taken so far. She is a very effective teacher, but her tests are very challenging. Tests are very tricky and sometimes ridiculous. They are way harder than the homework. Avoid this teacher if you do not enjoy math.","Dr. Andrews is a clear, engaging, and fun lecturer. She broke down tough material into digestible bits  and did a great job of relating it all to the everyday world. I have no doubt she will be a favorite prof here for years. Tough class (it's econ): 3 midterms and a final. She really wants to see her students succeed and is always there to help."],"courses":["ECON410","ECON410","ECON410","ECON410","ECON410","ECON410","ECON410H","ECON410","ECON410","ECON410"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ECON","catalog_nbr":510,"section":2,"class_nbr":9289,"title":"ADV MICRO THEORY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Murphey","room":"0314","days":"TuTh","time":"14","instructor":"PARREIRAS,SERGIO O","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["R"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":24,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1107129","fname":"Sergio","lname":"Parreiras","quality":"3.0","easiness":"2.7","help":"2.7","clarity":"2.7","topTag":"Inspirational (1)","grade":"2.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["INSPIRATIONAL"],"comments":["Dr. Parreiras is a great teacher! Advanced micro is a very hard math-intensive course, but his tests are very fair and he wants to see his students do well.  As long as you do the practice exams that he posts on sakai, you should be just fine!","A decent professor. Unfortunately his teaching isn't particularly clear. If you can learn the material on your own via the textbook you may be fine. If not you will not do well. Smart, Brazilian, and funny just not the best professor possible","Brazilian. Very Brazilian. Knows his stuff though. Class was pretty easy if you take the time to study on your own and understand the concepts. Sergio is always available to help too.","a very smart professor!","HORRIBLE prof. Can't teach and doesn't care whether you learn. Told us that he didn't care how we evaluated his class because he had tenure. Miserable experience in the course.","worst professor i've had, ever, doesnt look interested at all in class, his accent gets in the way of what he's saying, his classes are just useless, you would be a lot better off by just reading the book and not going to his lectures, he actually said he didnt care about prof evaluations because he has a tenure.","Great lecturer.  I just wish he would bring more of his (Tier 1) research to the classroom.  I suspect he was unimpressed with the quality of our class... Looking forward to Game Theory with him next spring.","The worst professor I have ever had, hands down.  Never prepared for lectures, which are a waste of time as he bumbles through material with his back to the class.  Takes 2 weeks to return exams and hw.  Exams are not necessarily on game theory (i.e. macro).  Unbelievable that the department lets him teach, let alone gave him tenure.","Great professor. Knows his material well. Makes occasional mistakes in class, but will go out of his way to explain subject matter.  Also gives out candy and money in class and makes difficult material easy to understand."],"courses":["ECON510","ECON511","ECON511","ECON511","ECON401","ECON410","ECON711","ECON711","ECON511"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ECON","catalog_nbr":510,"section":1,"class_nbr":10249,"title":"ADV MICRO THEORY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Hanes Hall","room":"0107","days":"TuTh","time":"14","instructor":"BIGLAISER,GARY A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":24,"enrl_tot":4,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1081489","fname":"Gary","lname":"Biglaiser","quality":"2.8","easiness":"4.0","help":"4.0","clarity":"4.0","topTag":"","grade":"4.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["","I heard a lot of complaints about the class before I took him, which surprises me in hindsight because I didn't have any problems with him.
