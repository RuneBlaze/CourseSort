He tries his best to be helpful and make the class interesting and overall is not a bad professor. The class is tough but the exams are not impossible and the curve is usually pretty good.","Umbanhowar's lectures are worthless. He stands up there and discusses vague examples and graphs, and doesn't have a clear point. It's better to just read the textbook to understand the material. The tests aren't too hard and are curved ALOT because everyone does poorly. I would stay away from him and his poor ecology teachings.","Absolutely terrible.  Lectures made 0 sense. The recitations are the only thing that  saved me from failing","Terrible.  Not even worth going to class.  I started reading the book before the class lectures and I started to think I could have taught the class better than he did.  He stutters a lot and spends the vast majority of the time talking about simple concepts and completely avoids the nitty-gritty details.  I also hated his voice.","Here's the deal: any class you take with this man will most likely end up in you getting a low grade UNLESS you have the initiative to read the book and study a LOT. The recitation section was helpful, but the professor himself is worthless. He jumps around in his lectures, he is hard to follow, and his exams are hard. Just saying' good luck.","Terrible professor, I could barely understand what he was saying because he mumbles and corrects himself so much. Regularly cancelled office hours and did not seem invested in teaching.","Avoid! He mumbles and has no clue what he is saying half the time. His drawing and diagrams are completely useless. You will be teaching yourself from the book if you want to even pass"],"courses":["BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}}]
