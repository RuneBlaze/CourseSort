An engaging lecturer who likes to walk around the hall and engage students with questions. He's very kind, but cares immensely about fairness. To engage outside of class, he catered dinner with self-selected groups of students throughout the semester.","Professor Fuchs is extremely passionate about comp sci. You can tell he's talented. However, this class was a pain in a butt. You would have to spend 4-10 hours in office hours because Fuchs could never teach. His lectures were about everything but what was needed for the assignment. Don't take this class. Great people, too much time.","He gives quizzes every week, that are just as hard as his tests. I went to every class, and studied before every quiz, yet had a quiz average of 55. Btw, I'm pretty good at computer science (got an A in Comp110, and an A in comp401 & 410). Tests are extremely hard. Even after the curve the average is in the 60s. And he's terrible at explanations.","This is a hard class, and the lectures feel long. If you don't understand something in the lecture, it's impossible to understand the rest of the lecture. He is very enthusiastic and nice. He frequently calls on people to answer questions.","Incredible professor - very involved and passionate, very clear in explanations (to the point where I'd zone out after a bit, but hey - I couldn't stay awake through a lecture if it was Will Ferrell up there), and insisted on having small group dinners with every person in the class - in a LECTURE HALL class.

Class format is just running through his class note, which is his version of condensed textbook but it's not easy to read. He seems ill-prepared for class and is anything but clarity for  lecture. I learned more from visiting TA than from class. He's nice personally tho. take MATH 381 instead of this","A super nice guy and even a little funny when I bothered to go to class. The biggest problem was the tests being too short, can you believe it... it would make a small mistake on any part hinder your grade too much, but otherwise Plaisted was a pretty easy a.","David Plaisted does not teach. He reads his notes in front of the class for 90 minutes, twice a week. The quizzes and tests from previous years are online, and they do not change from year to year. Getting an A requires no knowledge, only memorization. If you want an easy A, take COMP 455 with him, if you want to learn, take it with someone else.","He's the man","Easy class as it is very straight forward. Tests include a lot of true/false. Random pop quizzes to ensure attendance.","way too far behind on comp sci to be a real comp sci teacher, Very Nice Guy though","2-3 tests + a final exam. Pretty straightforward homework and random quizzes are given for attendance purposes. He's way too fond of multiple choice and true/false for automata theory."],"courses":["COMP283","COMP455","COMP455","COMP455","COMP455","COMP445","COMP455"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"COMP","catalog_nbr":691,"section":78,"class_nbr":16542,"title":"HONORS THESIS COMPUTER SCIENCELecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"BARUAH,SANJOY K","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=601001","fname":"Sanjoy","lname":"Baruah","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.7","help":"3.7","clarity":"3.7","topTag":"Tough Grader (3)","grade":"3.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["RESPECTED","LECTURE HEAVY","SKIP CLASS?

The exams were very challenging & required applied knowledge of the material. He was very helpful & much less intimidating in office hours. Definitely would recommend going to class, reading the book, doing practice problems, & starting assignments early.","He's a good professor. He explains things very clearly. The workload is small compared to other CS classes.","I will admit, the tests are hard. But I learned much more than the other section. During my year, the class was curved using a formula based upon how you did compared to the rest of the class. Despite this difficulty, I learned a great deal from the class. Go to class. Memorize his slides and do practice problems from the book. You will succeed.","One of the best CS professors I've had at UNC (of the 4 I've had thus far). Knows his stuff and conveys the information well. Gives good notes, assignments and exams are manageable. Is more concerned about what you learn rather than grades and such (I love profs like that). Some think he's boring, but I disagree completely. Would highly recommend.","Teaches at a high level and understands material, but very unhelpful outside of class and not very approachable.  Included test material that was not covered at all without warning (set math, etc. on first test - not hard but if you haven't used it in awhile and lose test points for it, pretty stupid).  Very harsh grader.","This guy is awesome, though he demands a good amount from his students.  The class is interesting, and he teaches in a way that makes the material pretty easy.  If you want to learn a lot, this is your man."],"courses":["COMP410","COMP410","COMP410","COMP410","COMP410","COMP181","COMP181"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
