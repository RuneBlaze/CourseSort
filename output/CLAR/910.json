However, if you come to class and actively attempt to take good notes, you can do really well (A) in his class. The problem is that 90% of people think that this class is a joke. If you don't pay attention and don't do the readings before exams, you'll get low grades.","Oh wow where do I start. First off, I will say, he is a nice guy and I'm sure he means well. But man, it was honestly the most boring class I have ever taken in my life. Class never had anything to do with anything. The final might has well been in a foreign language as half of the stuff was so foreign to me even though I never missed a class.","I honestly went to the class the first week and a half, for the midterm, and for the final. It's absolutely unbearable, don't bother going. And everyone else found it easy, but I disagree. His tests are annoyingly over tricky. I read the entire course pack and still bombed the final. Avoid this class like the plague.","I barely went to class before the midterm and got a 90, didn't go at all except to turn in my paper and got a good grade on the paper and final and got an A in the class. Really easy class, and you don't ever have to go","Prof. Haggis does nothing but ramble and laugh at random things he says. Don't bother going to class. For the midterm I studied just the course pack and made a decent grade. Stopped paying attention after that and passed with a B+ by studying the course pack and group study guide (he doesn't give one).","He rambles for the entire lecture and rarely finishes his thought process. Also we are always behind because he cant lecture clearly","Professor Haggis is a fun teacher and has a great sense of humor.  In class, he can occasionally ramble, but he gets to the point and teaches what you need to know to do well on tests.  I recommend doing your reading, except for Biers, that's pretty boring stuff.  Apply yourself and you'll do well.","This class is truly the worst thing I have ever taken.  He rambles in lecture and just talks about all of his projects.  Course pack was helpful.  Stay home and read the book and course pack.","This class made me want to die every day. His lectures had no structure- he used the same powerpoint of pictures all semester and rambled. He never once took attendance (odd for a FYS) and so didn't know our names, and the only assignments were a midterm paper and two final papers, so there was little room for mistakes. Not worth the requirements!","sorry..but he's boring. notes from class are important though.  use the books to fill out the study guides (yes, even the short answer portions-just vocab won't do you much good) the day before the exam and cram.  you should be fine.","take notes in class and read/skim through the course pack once or twice and you'll be fine. the tests are multiple choice and very very easy. he's an interesting lecturer as well.","Ancient Cities- Just study the Course Pack for the first half of the semester (when Donald teaches). My notes never made sense. Beth Greene taught the second half- go to class to take notes on her PowerPoints. Tests are fine as long as you study a lot. Do whatever extra credit is offered for sure, even if it means going to Duke for something!","I loved his lectures...I was also intrigued by his knowledge.  He is a really quirky guy, but also very nice.  I came when office hours had just ended once to speak to him and we ended up having a 2 hour chat.  Great guy. Awesome prof. Easy tests. Take it.","Hmm","Yes, he can be a little boring in the lectures at times but if you listen to what he's saying he obviously knows a lot, and on top of that the tests are very easy.  If you listen in class and read all of the material it's one of the easiest classes you can take here.","Oh my God! (I'm Atheist) but, anyway...Donald isn't boring at all - - I never slept in any of his classes.  Clar 375 was one of my favorites classes at UNC (so interesting) and he still the best teacher at UNC for me - - he knows everything.","He is very cute! He is one of the best professors that I ever had :) by Habib.","...everything said in the class is there, in the books. The pictures/slides that he show to us \r are amazing  - - they are the only thing that Donald needs to use as a guide to keep his \r lectures going on. For the exams, just come to the class (attendance is important) and, \r study the exam guide  review sheet. I really enjoyed take Clar 375 (Spri","Everyone else mentions how boring he can be.  But his tests were horrible.  You could memorize everything we read and still not know 1/2 the questionsWent to talk to him once and he wouldn't even look at me, barely said a word.  **** says he gives 9% A/A-, which is lower than the hardest chem classes. more than 30% get a C in clar20/120.
