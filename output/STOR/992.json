He gives lucid lecture slides and practical reviews for exams. Also, homework problems are simply another version of examples he mentions in class. Despite his accents, Ji organizes the progress of class effectively so that students can quickly follow up.","Lectures are difficult to follow due to his accent, but slides are informative. Much more helpful in office hours or after class.  Homework is considerably difficult and is graded for accuracy. Tests are extremely similar to practice exams. Overall not a bad guy, wants you to succeed and has reasonable expectations.","Very heavy on homework,  which is on the challenging side.  Exams are much easier than homework,  allowed a double sided formula sheet on midterms and 3 double sided sheets during  the final.","Outstanding lecturer, puts a great amount of work into his slides and homework solutions.  He posted the most detailed solutions and sample exams that I have seen at UNC.  Textbook was clear but has gaps ; read his solutions too.  Tough exams; final has more new material than you'll expect.  Difficult class but I learned a ton.","Most lazy professor I've ever had. I expect the professor to workout problems on the board but Ji barely touches the board except to write the most simple concepts like Venn diagrams. The textbook is over 23 years old! He says things like \"I leave it for you to solve\" for very important concepts. BE PREPARED TO TEACH YOURSELF, HE SHOWS NO MERCY.","Precooked ppts from the producer of the book. They lack detail on the slide and very poor examples. In class Ji will teach you the vague first half of the material, and expects you to teach yourself the other half. He will only read off the slide. Homework/Test: Book gives simple examples but then HW exercises are impossible. Tests are difficult.","His lectures were disorganized and repetitive to the point that I had trouble paying attention.","nice man, nice course","i had him for stats last year and he was a great professor. the class is definitely challenging, but he rewards you for hard work in the end. if you put in the time, you will do well. and keep up with the homework. i would recommend him","I had him for my FYS class and I loved it.  He is a really nice guy and really cares about your education.","I love this professor! He is awesome. Extremely friendly and helpful.","I had him for a fys and the class was a complete joke. He said he was giving everyone one of two grades: A or A-. He is really hard to understand though so I wouldn't suggest taking him for a regular math class, and he's not a very good teacher. But he's a really nice guy and will try to help you as much as he can.","He is hard to understand and he does not listen when you ask a question, and therfore never answers your question.","He is a good guy.  He explains everything in detail and easy to talk to out of class.  There is homework due pretty much each class.  The first 2 exams weren't to bad at all, but the final exam was rather difficult.  Overall a pretty good class that isn't too difficult.","great class","He doesn't teach much of the class himself, instead using a business student to do it. When he does teach, you don't really need his information for anything. The projects are easy and the class is mostly discussion."],"courses":["STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR435","STOR664","STATASDF","STOR064","STAT031","STOR064","STOR064","STAT155","006","STAT006P"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"STOR","catalog_nbr":992,"section":11,"class_nbr":6174,"title":"MASTER'S (NON-THESIS)","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"NOBEL,ANDREW B","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2064104","fname":"Andrew","lname":"Nobel","quality":"3.5","easiness":"1.0","help":"1.0","clarity":"1.0","topTag":"GROUP PROJECTS (1)","grade":"1.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK"],"comments":["I took Nobels freshman seminar class, STOR 89. it was pretty easy especially because there are no exams! there was some homework, but overall the workload is very minimal. therefore even if you think it is difficult it doesnt really matter because you will never be tested on the material.

She knows her stuff very well, however she is not the best at conveying information to her students. Tests are weighted most of your grade; 25% midterm and 45% final.","Shu is a good teacher if you are willing to pay any attention at all. If you took AP calc in high school, you will be fine in her class. If you have not, she can be hard to understand, but it is still possible to get an A. Attendance is not mandatory.","Professor Lu is a nice woman with a funny personality, however, she isn't very good at explaining new concepts. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has taken calculus before, but you may struggle if the material is new to you.","If you have any basic knowledge of calculus, you will do well in this class. Her English is minimal, but the class is still an easy A if you understand calc at all.","seems like an intelligent person, but her english is SO bad and she gets flustered very easily.. class is easy though if you've taken calculus and attendance is not mandatory..  just went to class when homework was due or we had an exam and i still got a B :)","She has horrible English and gets lost easily. Our final had multiple mistakes that needed to be corrected by her during the exam. There is no book assigned for this class, however one would really help, as her teaching is so inadequate that even basic concepts can be confusing.","Sometimes hard to understand because english is not her native language. Helpful to have taken pre-calc or calc in high school. Sometimes it seems that she's forgotten the class is even there. Definitely knows the content she's teaching so if you can get her attention she's pretty helpful. Gives extra credit in class so it's good to go.","Dr. Shu Lu refuses to explain things she moves along quickly and barely realizes her students are present. Sometimes she is hard to understand because english is not her native language. She does not answer questions in class she simply says &quot;office hours&quot;.

Lectures are very difficult to follow even though the material is not terribly difficult.  He assigns homework pretty much every class and then never goes over them in class.  Also he grades very strictly and will take off a lot of points for a small mistake with no feedback.","Quoc means well but he is not a clear teacher. The material is easy enough, especially if you took calc ab in high school. Have to go to class to turn in homework. one midterm and a quiz besides the final, and the final counts for most of your grade. If you end up with him it's not end of the world, but try to take another teacher.","If you have taken Calculus, this class is a breeze. Sometimes I skipped class and will still be fully aware of what was going on, and most of the time, I regretted showing up. He was hard to communicate with at times and I think the class was a little more difficult for people who didn't have a strong background in calc.","Prof. Tran-Dinh, in both his first year of teaching and first year in the country, graded strictly, and rapport with students was nonexistent. He seems like a very nice man, but lectures were confusing, and office hours confused concepts further. Definitely the hardest professor for STOR 113.
