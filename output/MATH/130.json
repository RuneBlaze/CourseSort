She expects students to work on 9 homework assignments a week along with reading every section that we learn while teaching yourself. If you end up in a class with a grad student like me you literally go to class and get taught nothing.","I hated Shryock and this course.  You were expected to teach yourself everything and there was tons of homework and exams.","Shryock has a bad rep and I was really scared to take the class, but honestly I really liked her. She explains the math really well and makes sure you understand. There is a lot of out of class work but nothing thats too tough. Find a good group to work with and you'll be fine. The tests are hard and short but you're prepared for it!","Shryock is very condescending but she is actually a decent teacher. She gives you all of the materials you need to succeed and is helpful in during class assignments. People that rate her poorly didn't put in the work to do well in this class. If you study and do practice problems and work hard to understand, you will be fine.","Shryock usually expects the most, as she should, from Carolina students. The material is the most advanced precalculus I've seen, and the tests can be difficult (all multiple choice with at least 6 answers (sometimes 15 for trigonometry problems)). The homework is challenging but prepares you well for tests. Recommend as an intro class before calc.","I actually enjoyed this class, unlike many of the other reviewers.  I always knew what to expect for class and tests, because the practice tests she gives are just like the actual test.  If you need help, you can email her, and she will reply promptly, and you can also attend office hours for extra help.  The textbook is USELESS though.","I feel like people get the wrong idea about Shryock. Yes, she's very tough and can be seen as Satan at times, but grow a pair. This is college, you're not in high school anymore. The way the course is set up is you have to teach yourself everything, which is key to succeed in College. This course challenges you, but it's not impossible.","Not only is this class flipped, there are before class, during class, and homework assignments for each section covered in class. I couldn't spend time actually learning the material because of the amount of graded assignments. Try to take this class over the summer when it isn't flipped or  at a different school because it's time consuming.","Calculus will always be calculus, there's no way around that. However, Dr. Shryock will always help you! All work is online (including tests) but it's easy to use. The textbook is almost useless, but you can copy and paste questions into google ;) basically, if you go to class, take notes on During Class assignments, and don't give up 3","Avoid this course unless you're prepared to teach yourself. Shryock relies on TA's to teach classes and you most likely won't see her all semester. During my section of the course is when she made her office hours, so me and my peers had to choose between class or going to her office hours. Doesn't seem to care about her students. TAs were nice.","She is one of the worst professors I've had at UNC. She is an excessively hard grader, moves extremely fast through the course work, and poorly explains the material if you are not good at math. Someone who has previously taken calculus before might not find it as difficult, but she definitely makes the class harder than necessary.","This is the worst class I have ever taken. It's flipped, which means the instructor literally does not teach at all. It's basically like taking an online class; you watch lecture videos and do WebAssign work almost daily. She also doesn't give partial credit on tests (which are also taken online) and there is no extra credit in the class.","Though Shryock shows up for class, she may as well stay home. Lecture is pointless because it isn't teaching. She simply rushes through a few examples and then you are on your own. The web platform (Webassign) required for this course is difficult and picky.  Tests are ridiculously hard and the averages linger around 60%.","Math 130 was the worst class i've ever taken at Carolina and i'm a science major. I went to tutoring ever week. She is awful. DO NOT TAKE!","Doesn't care about her students in the slightest. Is very condescending and rude to people who don't understand what she is saying immediately. Even heard other professors in the mathematics department saying similar things about her.","Don't take this class.  Just don't do it.  Please don't.  I promise you will hate it.","As someone said before, don't take her Math 130 class unless you absolutely have to. She never showed up (except the first day of class), so it is the TAs that help  you with the homework. You have to teach yourself basically everything in this class, which is pretty frustrating and annoying. I got an A but had to really work my butt off for it.","Do not take a class taught by Dr. Shryock, and do not take MATH 130 unless you absolutely have to.  This class was not rewarding in the slightest, contained prolific homework assignments and before-class assignments that were near impossible to accomplish unless you camped out in the Math Help Center or hired a private tutor or both.","Saw her once. The rest of the time I had a TA who barely knew what we were studying and definitely didn't know how to teach.

She explains the math really well and makes sure you understand. There is a lot of out of class work but nothing thats too tough. Find a good group to work with and you'll be fine. The tests are hard and short but you're prepared for it!","Shryock is very condescending but she is actually a decent teacher. She gives you all of the materials you need to succeed and is helpful in during class assignments. People that rate her poorly didn't put in the work to do well in this class. If you study and do practice problems and work hard to understand, you will be fine.","Shryock usually expects the most, as she should, from Carolina students. The material is the most advanced precalculus I've seen, and the tests can be difficult (all multiple choice with at least 6 answers (sometimes 15 for trigonometry problems)). The homework is challenging but prepares you well for tests. Recommend as an intro class before calc.","I actually enjoyed this class, unlike many of the other reviewers.  I always knew what to expect for class and tests, because the practice tests she gives are just like the actual test.  If you need help, you can email her, and she will reply promptly, and you can also attend office hours for extra help.  The textbook is USELESS though.","I feel like people get the wrong idea about Shryock. Yes, she's very tough and can be seen as Satan at times, but grow a pair. This is college, you're not in high school anymore. The way the course is set up is you have to teach yourself everything, which is key to succeed in College. This course challenges you, but it's not impossible.","Not only is this class flipped, there are before class, during class, and homework assignments for each section covered in class. I couldn't spend time actually learning the material because of the amount of graded assignments. Try to take this class over the summer when it isn't flipped or  at a different school because it's time consuming.","Calculus will always be calculus, there's no way around that. However, Dr. Shryock will always help you! All work is online (including tests) but it's easy to use. The textbook is almost useless, but you can copy and paste questions into google ;) basically, if you go to class, take notes on During Class assignments, and don't give up 3","Avoid this course unless you're prepared to teach yourself. Shryock relies on TA's to teach classes and you most likely won't see her all semester. During my section of the course is when she made her office hours, so me and my peers had to choose between class or going to her office hours. Doesn't seem to care about her students. TAs were nice.","She is one of the worst professors I've had at UNC. She is an excessively hard grader, moves extremely fast through the course work, and poorly explains the material if you are not good at math. Someone who has previously taken calculus before might not find it as difficult, but she definitely makes the class harder than necessary.","This is the worst class I have ever taken. It's flipped, which means the instructor literally does not teach at all. It's basically like taking an online class; you watch lecture videos and do WebAssign work almost daily. She also doesn't give partial credit on tests (which are also taken online) and there is no extra credit in the class.","Though Shryock shows up for class, she may as well stay home. Lecture is pointless because it isn't teaching. She simply rushes through a few examples and then you are on your own. The web platform (Webassign) required for this course is difficult and picky.  Tests are ridiculously hard and the averages linger around 60%.","Math 130 was the worst class i've ever taken at Carolina and i'm a science major. I went to tutoring ever week. She is awful. DO NOT TAKE!","Doesn't care about her students in the slightest. Is very condescending and rude to people who don't understand what she is saying immediately. Even heard other professors in the mathematics department saying similar things about her.","Don't take this class.  Just don't do it.  Please don't.  I promise you will hate it.","As someone said before, don't take her Math 130 class unless you absolutely have to. She never showed up (except the first day of class), so it is the TAs that help  you with the homework. You have to teach yourself basically everything in this class, which is pretty frustrating and annoying. I got an A but had to really work my butt off for it.","Do not take a class taught by Dr. Shryock, and do not take MATH 130 unless you absolutely have to.  This class was not rewarding in the slightest, contained prolific homework assignments and before-class assignments that were near impossible to accomplish unless you camped out in the Math Help Center or hired a private tutor or both.","Saw her once. The rest of the time I had a TA who barely knew what we were studying and definitely didn't know how to teach. This course is basically self-taught, and it's made all the more difficult by the fact that there are very few examples given to show you how to solve the problems. I'm very good at math - but I almost failed this course."],"courses":["MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MAT130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH130","MATH152","MATH130","MATH130","130","MATH130","MATH130","UNC56192699","130","130"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":130,"section":951,"class_nbr":12903,"title":"PRECALCULUS MATH","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0224","days":"TuTh","time":"18","instructor":"SHRYOCK,BRENDA M","load":"75","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":10,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=546460","fname":"Brenda","lname":"Shryock","quality":"2.5","easiness":"4.0","help":"4.0","clarity":"4.0","topTag":"Tough Grader (18)","grade":"4.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Many sections end up with a graduate student teaching the course. I cannot say much on the professor. She came in our section three times, typically telling us she was mad we did awful on the tests. Class teaches you nothing, you mainly learn from the book and youtube. You have to go to class to work through in class assignments.","Math 130 was designed by Brenda Shryock and it is terrible. She expects students to work on 9 homework assignments a week along with reading every section that we learn while teaching yourself.
