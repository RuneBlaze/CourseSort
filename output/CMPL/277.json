He talks himself in a circle and is difficult to follow","Personable, funny, and serious as hell, Shayne is truly one of UNC's best. He explains dense and complicated topics with an unparalleled combination of specificity and accessibility. He's genuinely interested and committed to his students and their scholarship; office hours are frequently extended so that all seeking help get it. Brilliant prof!","Hands down, Shayne will be the best professor you've ever had. And the hardest. He is ALWAYS available to talk, really wants you to understand, and grades kindly if you show you care. Prepare to bust your ass doing tons of really dense readings and rewriting your papers at least 3 times, but it will be the most rewarding experience of your life!","This guy is probably the most intelligent professor I've encountered in 6 years at this school. For his age, he has such a vast knowledge of his field that it is almost hard to keep up with the discussions, but that's not his fault. Extremely helpful, the classes are NOT hard, make use of his office hours. An awesome prof.","","Awesome teacher!  My first class in which I can truly say that I had fun while learning.  He can be a bit tough but you will learn a great deal.  Participate in class and make use of his office hours."],"courses":["CMPL123","CMPL251","CMPL251","CMPL490","CMPL123","ENGL148"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
