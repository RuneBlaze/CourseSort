Really nothing too bad, but working very hard is necessary for an A.","Dr. Hackney is seriously the most inequitable man here at UNC. His tests were extremely unfair. The TAs in the class even would say \"It's not in the book, it wasn't on the lecture slides but I'm pretty sure he talked about this in class\" to which we all disagreed on. There are also 7 exams and a final, which makes for an extremely stressful class.","Nice","I do not like him","This dude's a hack. He's super anal about you using your phone in class and is exceptionally boring, making paying attention nearly impossible.
