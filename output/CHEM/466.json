I took it during a summer session so maybe it was just hard because it was packed into 5.5 weeks. Meek is a really good professor and knows what he is talking about, but dam are his tests HARD. Lots of studying, but if you pay attention to lectures you're good to go. Spent lots of time studying and did well","I took the Honors section of Organic Chemistry with Meek. Sure, 90% of your grade is calculated by merit of your Exam average, and the other 10% by pop quizzes (!); the flip side is that you really learn A LOT from possibly the most intelligent individual at UNC. Meek is a genius, and he teaches with an intensity that guarantees you WILL learn.","Dr. Meek is a really good teacher! If you're willing to work hard it will pay off. I didn't like organic chemistry before Dr. Meek. He wasn't about memorizing what was in the textbook, he really wanted his students to understand chemistry. His exams are tough but I always learned from them. Just make sure you know the basics!","Worst teacher I've had in college.  Not only seemingly disinterested in teaching, but also poor communicator, and gives you no idea of what kinds of things will be on the tests.","He doesn't offer reviews. He doesn't give any indication of material that will be on exams and they are extremely difficult. Also MasteringChem is apart of his curriculum. DO NOT TAKE CHEM262 WITH MEEK!","He showed no concern for our constant low test averages (53,53,51). He didnt change teaching styleto adapt to the class. Meek doesn't give review sessions. Not clear in office Hours. He understands chemistry well but cannot convey it. He basically reads word for word from the text. Tests= extremely foreign material. NEVER take his class."],"courses":["CHEM262","CHEM262H","CHEM262","CHEM262","CHEM262","CHEM262"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
