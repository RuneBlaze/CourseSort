He is what a professor should be.  The course will give a framework for you life if you work at it.","Larry Grossberg is clearly brilliant and passionate about his subject.    In spite of being a world-famous scholar, he is approachable and student-friendly.  But to echo others:  this class will take more than all of your time and the materials will cost you big bucks. Regardless, it is a fabulous class. Plus, he's kinda hot in a geeky sort of way","Larry is a true intellectual, and this class is worth taking. However be warned: this is not an introductory class, there is A LOT to read and make sure you know something about the sources of Cultural studies (Marxism, Gramsci, BCCS). Don't do that and you'll find yourself scratching your head so many times that you will bleed to death.","Larry is brilliant. The material is incredibly complex and his expectations are high, but it can be one of the most intellectually rewarding classes you will ever take if you make the committment to it.","No Comments"],"courses":["200","COMM250","COMM250","COMM200","COMM250"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
