He had nothing interesting to say about any of the pieces we listened to. He was not insightful and utterly, utterly failed to convey what is interesting and worthwhile about classical music. Whether you like classical or not, don't take 142 with him!","Nadas got me into opera. Really top-notch professor who is quite enthusiastic about opera. He seems to know everything.","This class was definitely my favorite. I was surrounded by art majors but that wasn't a problem. We talked, watched and compared operas all class long. So chill, so easy, and now I love opera..... Nadas is amazing, he is obsessed with opera, italy and anything to do with opera and italy. Friendly, silly and super nice. TAKE THIS CLASS","MUS 57 with Nadas is a great class. There are 3 papers, no more than 15 pages for the whole semester. He is very enthusiastic and amazing. I cannot stress how much I loved him as a professor. Also, random side note, he sounds just like DUSTIN HOFFMAN! How can you say no to DUSTIN HOFFMAN's voice&#63;&#63; The answer is - you can't. He's amazing.","Nadas is a kind, enthusiastic professor with a sense of humor.  He loves his topic and works hard to engage his students.  I got the feeling though that he didn't have a lot to do with the actual grading process - TAs did all the exam review and grading, and several times he wasn't even present in class.  The class, however, is interesting and fun.","John Nadas is one of my FAVORITE professors at Carolina.  He's very passionate about the subject matter and about teaching.  I love going to class and always leave in a good mood.  Thanks to him, my love and appreciation for Baroque music has grown tremendously.  I recommend his class to EVERYONE!!  Having Laurie McManus as a TA is an added bonus!","Prof Nadas is great, I would highly recommend his class to fulfill the VP credit!","Fabulous professor!  I learned so much because of his enthusiasm for teaching.","Wow, what a great class. It's really easy and very interesting. Prof. Nadas is a very enthusiastic and friendly guy and makes class extremely enjoyable. I really doubt the paper would exist without the absurd rule change that requires it. Going to class is important since the textbooks are somewhat hard to read. Nadas is the man!","Wonderful proffesor! He teaches his subject very well and often includes videos of performances and CD clips. Tests are extremely easy because he tells you exactly what will be on it. I think I used the text book once, but most of the information for tests I take from the internet and lecture notes. Highly recommended! One easy paper 5-7 pages.","Fabulous prof! Had this class at 10am and it was always good! Come to class, take good notes, do the reading, and you'll do great. Very easy going and helpful and the TAs are wonderful. Would recommend Nadas to anyone looking for a good class.","Great prof who doesn't try to make things too hard and gives students the upper hand when it comes to tests.","No Comments","The class is extremely easy. He tells you exactly what's on the tests beforehand, practically impossible to get lower than an A if you study. Also very interesting, though some people who don't appreciate classical music can feel bored."],"courses":["MUSC142","MUSIC142","MUSC57","MUSC57","MUS57","MUSC142","MUSC282","MUSC142","MUSC258","MUSC282","MUSIC282","MUSC82","MUSC42","MUSC042","MUSC42"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
