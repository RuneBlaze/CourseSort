Dr. Sheriff is super knowledgeable in her field and a great lecturer. There are 10 pop quizzes and the readings can get tedious and long. There are a LOT of papers worth a large portion but she gives rewrites (she's so great). The tests aren't hard at all if you pay attention in class.","Dr. Sheriff is a good professor- really sweet and passionate about art. The papers were a hard to get used to, but she allows rewrites. 10 pop quizzes on the readings throughout the semester that aren't too difficult, but need to read. Tests aren't too hard either as long as you paid attention in class. Lectures were not very visual analysis heavy","Dr. Sheriff is one of the nicest professors I've ever had here. She really cares. I would recommend this class to someone who's taken an art class previously because I was a little lost, but she really helped me out when things got confusing! Such a nice lady.","Professor Sheriff is definitely one of the best professors I've had at UNC. Really interesting class. You need to go to class the take the reading quizzes and learn from the lectures, but it's all very interesting!","Without a doubt, the most interesting, supportive professor that I have ever had.","One of the best teachers on this campus or any campus.","Best professor I ever had.

You have to memorize 50+ pieces of art (where it's from, who made it, what era, what material, etc) for all tests. Final not cumulative though. TA's grade all papers (two) and are pretty fair. Lectures extremely boring. Skip and read the book instead, it's easier.","Lectures require PRECISE & careful notes. Tests are based on what's covered in lecture; no outlines are posted online, just pictures. You can miss one, two lectures and be screwed. Exams are essay format and require lots of memorization. Tough on papers. Very helpful during office hours. His jokes are terrible but unexpected, which makes them okay.","Dr. Douglas is by far one of the best profs I've had at UNC. You must go to class and take notes, but his lectures are fascinating and he's crystal clear. Very approachable and personable. Great professor.","The hardest class I've taken at UNC.  You must go to class and take very good notes because all exams are essay based.  Get a good TA, they are the sole determinant in your grade.  Would NOT advise taking his 151 class.","His Art History class was fairly difficult, granted I had a god awful TA. You must go to class, you must take thorough notes to do well since all the exams are essay-based.

She was very into the subject she taught and would relate almost all of the art pieces to random stories she had (good for ADHD-minded people like me to connect ideas to). She was very helpful and clear about what she wanted.","Verkerk is very passionate about art history, and this makes lectures interesting! There are 3 exams (2 midterms and a final) that involve a lot of memorization (the work's name, time period, bracket dates, etc.) and a 10-page paper. They're fast-paced. My TA was great; however, my only complaint is that grading among the TAs was inconsistent.","Professor Verkerk is a kind professor. She is very passionate about her subject matter. The class itself is not hard. There are 2 tests and one 10 page paper. However, if you don't go to lecture and take notes, you will not do well on the tests. The tests are very  straightforward, but tons of memorization about 50 pieces of art is required.","Interesting and funny professor, and the course material is surprisingly interesting.  Unfortunately, the tests were rushed and difficult, the TA's grade inconsistently, and it is flat out a ton of memorization.  Not the worst class to have, but there are probably easier VP's to take.","Hilarious professor, probably my favorite so far. Material was very boring but she cracked jokes and made it bearable. No work other than 3 tests and 10 page paper. A lot of memorization on the tests. Paper was not that bad. I found that my brain switches to artsy mode around 3 am. She is a great professor but there are probably easier VP credits.","She makes it way harder than it needs to be and the TA's are viciously cruel and grade tests and the ten page paper harshly. AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. NOT WORTH THE GEN ED FULFILLMENTS.","I really enjoyed her Art 151 class, and it was not too difficult. There is not much work throughout the semester, there is just a final paper and three exams.","Tests do not accurately or appropriately evaluate the students on their understanding of the material. Instead, they ask you to memorize facts about art instead of evaluating the art or appreciating the art in historical context. The TAs are hit or miss. Lectures move slowly.","Favorite class of the semester. Only took it as it covered a lot of Gen Ed requirements and has ended up being the most enjoyable of the semester. Verkerk is an engaging professor although the exams are hard. A series of definitions with 90 seconds for each, identification of sculptures/paintings-3 minutes each and then a 20 minute essay!","Verkerk is a fun professor, but her tests are unreasonably difficult when they should be much easier.  I knew all the information we needed to know but got poor grades on the exams because she intentionally rushes you (she told us we would probably not have enough time for the exam). Fun teacher, but bad class.","Outstanding Professor.","My favorite professor of my freshman year. I took art history as a whim and now its my major! Her lectures are engaging however coursework and tests can be very difficult.","Probably one of my favorite classes I have taken - and I'm an environmental science major. If you appreciate the material and are good at memorization this class easy. Pay attention during lectures, the  book isn't entirely necessary. Verkerk is a really great professor, she really is passionate about the class and is kind of funny at times","Dr. Verkerk is really fun and tries her best to make the lecture as interesting as possible. Reading isn't really necessary for this course as most of the test information is from lecture. Grades really come down to the individual TAs and how harshly they grade so try to find a good one.","slide shows are hard to pay attn to... really boring.","Teacher is funny and informative, but terrible textbook. If you already know a bit of art history like I did, dont take this. if the word &quot;contrapposto&quot; means nothing to you, go ahead, its a pretty good intro class.  The essay is easy and she give you all semester for it, the test isn't bad if you make flashcards and have a good memory for dates.","Decent class, the lectures are interesting. The recitations make me want to kill myself, though. They are about the longest fifty minutes of my life. She should try and make them more engaging. Maybe we could actually do art in the recitations.","She's funny, explains the subject in good detail, and makes even the prehistoric art interesting.","If you're an art history buff, you'll love this class.  Dr. Verkerk really tries to make things interesting.  Otherwise, those dark classrooms and slide shows will put you in a coma.","Good professor who knows her field, but good luck staying awake during lecture!

He's very easy to talk to and ready to help you write for any of those assignments.","This class was a great class for your first semester of freshman year.

He knows alot of stuff about African American art and he's not afraid to show it! But I do have to say he was sometimes reaallly boring. Sometimes you would go in there and see half the class asleep. Very easy A however, and you learn a handful of things about art as well.","Absolutely recommend ART 287 with Bowles. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about the class and makes it interesting. Grading is 2 short papers, 2 outside event responses, essay midterm and final, and recitation participation - workload of a 100-level class, so an A is very doable. TAs will also read/comment on papers before turning in.","He is a good teacher and has a wealth of information about Art History as a whole. The class was slightly long but he regularly ends class early and is helpful with assignments.","This class was a first-year seminar on African-American Art in the Carolinas. It was interesting and an easy A. I usually went twice a week to class, even though it takes place three times a week, and still did great. Bowles is also a super nice professor.","Prof. Bowles was my FYS teacher on African American Art in the Carolinas.

Class was just confusing, a lot of abstract concepts you had to connect to readings. The many guest speakers were interesting, but his lectures were painful. I ended up with a high grade after learning to BS my way through the essay tests without reading.","This class is interesting, but you have to be willing to think very far out, and play by Prof. Herman's rules. The Keywords are very important. His lectures have a lot of cool visual material, but sometimes it is hard to get cold keyword meanings out of them. I had to take VERY thorough notes. Do not take this class if you expect a cakewalk.","Be ready to memorize lots of insignificant definitions! Word for word! You will have to spew them back out on the tests, which basically consist of applying ridiculous keywords to images that have nothing to do with them. The material is interesting, but it really gets lost amidst the academic jargon.","Professor Herman obsesses over &quot;Key Words&quot; which are basically simple words (such as visibility) that he complicates excessively. His class is like listening to an audio recording of a dictionary of visual culture; he can be very pretentious, and his grading can be arbitrary.
