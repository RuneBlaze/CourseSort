I had no interest in Classics before taking this class, but learned more than I ever thought I would about Western history, art, philosophy and morality.","Hilariously difficult, patronizing, and humiliating. Her criticism is so unnecessarily rude that her point often gets lost. My class was only a first-year seminar, but it's been my hardest this semester. Unless you're very, very serious about learning Classics, avoid this professor. Not worth your time.","I had no interest in this subject before I took this class and was really dreading it, but she made it incredibly interesting, one of the best classes I've taken at UNC. Tests are a LOT of writing and require a pretty good grasp of the material."],"courses":["CLAS240","CLAS060H","CLAS241"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
