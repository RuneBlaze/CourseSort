Lectures are very difficult to follow even though the material is not terribly difficult.  He assigns homework pretty much every class and then never goes over them in class.  Also he grades very strictly and will take off a lot of points for a small mistake with no feedback.","Quoc means well but he is not a clear teacher. The material is easy enough, especially if you took calc ab in high school. Have to go to class to turn in homework. one midterm and a quiz besides the final, and the final counts for most of your grade. If you end up with him it's not end of the world, but try to take another teacher.","If you have taken Calculus, this class is a breeze. Sometimes I skipped class and will still be fully aware of what was going on, and most of the time, I regretted showing up. He was hard to communicate with at times and I think the class was a little more difficult for people who didn't have a strong background in calc.","Prof. Tran-Dinh, in both his first year of teaching and first year in the country, graded strictly, and rapport with students was nonexistent. He seems like a very nice man, but lectures were confusing, and office hours confused concepts further. Definitely the hardest professor for STOR 113. Hopefully his teaching will improve with experience."],"courses":["STOR113","STOR113","STOR113","STOR113"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR"]}}]
