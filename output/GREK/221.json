Its not too hard to do well in his class but expect a lot of B+ papers and a struggle to earn that A. Attendance is mandatory but he's not puinitive if you're out. Theres a lot of reading in this class, so only take it if you actually like reading epics. All in all a good FYS.","Best classic professor I've had yet. Has a voice like a radio announcer. He's easy to listen to, not cruel to students who are having trouble with passages, and very very very knowledgeable about the material. Take him."],"courses":["CLAS055","LATN34"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
