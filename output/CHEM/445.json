He gives practice tests ahead of time, and the actual tests contain problems of equal difficulty. Attendance isn't required, and even though the class can be boring, it is beneficial to attend.","Dr. Wightman covers topics very clearly and at a reasonable pace. He works hard to keep his lectures organized. His tests are fair and he is helpful in office hours. However, his voice and lecture style can put some to sleep.","No Comments"],"courses":["CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
