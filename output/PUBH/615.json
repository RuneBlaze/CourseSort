She does everything she can to make sure you understand the material. High enthusiasm helps too","Profe. Anne is the absolute best! She was clear on what to study for tests and what she wanted in writing sections and what not. She will narrow down what you need to study for things like the cultural section so you don't have to study 10 subjects and only two are on there. Definitely take Profe. Anne!","Profe Anne was an absolutely wonderful 203 professor. She made what she expected very clear and was always there for us when we needed help. Class was pretty fun and straightforward. Tests weren't bad and the grading was clear. If you have the chance, take her for anything. She is a fantastic professor."],"courses":["SPAN105","SPAN105","203","SPAN203"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
