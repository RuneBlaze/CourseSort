There is a lot of assigned reading, about 70-100 pages per class, so if you get behind, you'll drown. The tests and pop \"quizzes\" are straight from the lecture notes. The quizzes are one question and are designed to take attendance- he won't give you less than an 8/10 if you turn it in. No papers","If you do not like to read, this class is not for you because you will be reading close to 300 pages a week or about 100 pages per class. It is a big time investment and the material is not particularly interesting towards the end of the semester. He is an enthusiastic lecturer and really helpful. Do not get behind in reading, or you will  drown.","Interesting fellow, funny at times. Enjoys what he teaches, and tries to make class relatable. large amount of assigned reading. Not an easy A, but definitely doable.","I LOVE Dr. Grillo. He is super nice and funny, and really fun to listen too. He's very enthusiastic about what he teaches, which makes lectures enjoyable. The class has a lot of assigned readings, which you must read in order to pass. Not an easy A, but also not too difficult. It's a very interesting class with one of my favorite professors at UNC!","He doesn't allow electronics in class which is annoying. You will read about 100 pages for every class.","Luca is a super awesome professor but hard. This class is very heavy on homework. I would not take it if you are just looking for connection credits (like I was). Only take this class (History of Augustus) if you are interested in the topic. Not an easy A at all.","I loved Luca! He had the clearest class outline I've ever seen, and he's adorable with his Italian accent and sweater vests"],"courses":["CLAS122","CLAS122","CLAS122","CLAS122","CLAS122","CLAS257","CLAS122"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
