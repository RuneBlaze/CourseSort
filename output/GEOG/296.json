It's not too hard to do well in here if you pay attention in lecture and start the papers early (as I did not lol).","Spare yourself from this class if you can! She doesn't curve at all and the class gets so detailed and boring.","She seems to forget this is an intro course, and that students aren't required to have prior knowledge of many of the topics she goes over and as a result won't go in depth with certain ideas. She is not a very entertaining lecturer and teaches directly off the powerpoint, and the midterm comes directly from the final."],"courses":["GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG130","GEO130","GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG130"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":296,"section":37,"class_nbr":7688,"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"REYES,ALVARO ANDRES","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["R"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1716142","fname":"Alvaro","lname":"Reyes","quality":"3.0","easiness":"3.3","help":"3.3","clarity":"3.3","topTag":"Amazing lectures (1)","grade":"3.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["This prof says it how it is and why it is, so if you're not ready to really delve into a deeper analysis of large, overarching concepts, this class is not for you.  Overall, the class material is super interesting and the prof does a great job of conveying info with urgency, intrigue, and real-ness.","Easily one of my favorite professors at UNC. Dunno why he got bad ratings. He's one of the smartest people I've ever met in the social/cultural geography field. His higher level classes are totally discussion based, which makes immersion into the topics a lot easier. It's hard to drift off and lose interest despite his slightly monotone voice.","The class is not hard, but it is extremely boring. I stopped going to class and only did a couple of the readings for the essay(which was graded easily) and still managed to pull a B in the class.","I don't think he has any idea what he's talking about. He reads straight from the slides almost verbatim. Also, he has misspelled words on his PowerPoints (even though they invented spell check)."],"courses":["GEOG225","GEOG423GEOG480","GEOG121","GEOG121"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":296,"section":38,"class_nbr":7689,"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"CHEN,XIAODONG","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["R"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1774409","fname":"Chen","lname":"Xiaodong","quality":"0.0","easiness":"N/A","help":"N/A","clarity":"N/A","topTag":"","grade":"N/A","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":[],"courses":[],"courseRatings":[]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":296,"section":39,"class_nbr":7690,"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"LENTZ,CHRISTIAN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["R"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2082376","fname":"Christian","lname":"Lentz","quality":"4.3","easiness":"2.7","help":"2.7","clarity":"2.7","topTag":"Inspirational (2)","grade":"2.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["INSPIRATIONAL","TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["I am obsessed with him & will take more classes with him. He is brilliant & his lectures will often make you think about things in a way you never have before. He is very helpful & truly cares about his students. He has made geography so interesting to me that I'm considering minoring, and I never would've thought I would ever say that. He rocks.","Professor Lentz is very knowledgeable and very helpful. He will answer any questions that you have. There are no tests, a few quizzes, and a few papers. He is pretty strict when grading the paper. He assigned short readings before each class and participation is required. Overall it was a great class and I would take it again.","Professor Lentz makes class enjoyable and really encourages class participation. There are no tests, and very few quizzes, so the majority of your grade comes from papers. If you are a superb writer, then you will be fine, but otherwise, he is a very strict grader and isn't all too  clear on what exactly makes a paper a great paper in his eyes."],"courses":["GEOG121","GEOG064","GEOG064"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"GEOG","catalog_nbr":296,"section":41,"class_nbr":7692,"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDY","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"OLSON,ELIZABETH ANN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["R"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1817177","fname":"Elizabeth","lname":"Olson","quality":"4.3","easiness":"3.6","help":"3.6","clarity":"3.6","topTag":"Skip class?

I signed up for her class as an afterthought and became a Geography minor after one semester with her. I took another of her classes the next year because she was so great and I've never met a professor who cares more about what she does and about her students.","This class and Professor Olson are the reasons I decided to become a geography major. She is an excellent and thought-provoking lecturer. For a 100 level class this was more challenging than might be expected, but it was very worth it and the take away is incredible.","Professor Olson is one of the nicest, best, and most enthusiastic professors you will ever find. If you take an intro-level class with her (I had 125), be aware that it's just as difficult (if not more so) as her upper-level class. That being said I still did well in both classes, learned a TON, and absolutely loved every minute of class with her.","I was so excited to take this class, but Prof. Olson made the subject so much harder than what it could have been. Her tests were very hard and I never knew what exactly she was looking for. (Everything is written)","Way too difficult for an intro level class. I was a third year geography major when I took this class and I was well versed in the subject, but the tests even went over my head a couple times. Not an easy grader, slightly condescending, but you will likely learn a decent amount in this class if you really invest in it."],"courses":["GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG424","GEOG125","GEOG130"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
