At first she seems a bit all over the place, but if you take notes and pay attention you'll be fine. I only used the textbook for the final. If she doesn't understand your question, just keep clarifying. She really knows what she's talking about!","If you're a Spanish major this is required so you have no choice but to take this course. If possible, wait for another professor to be assigned to teach. She is so disorganized and takes SO long to grade things/give them back. Going into the final you will have no idea what you have in the class. She is a lazy grader. However she is smart.","She's very kind& cute but I find myself leaving lecture confused about the actual application. I agree, she is a fair grader! The homework is extremely do-able. Don't worry about that aspect at all. Not a bad class all things considered, but I struggle with grammar, so I am reminded of all of the things I don't know that I thought I already knew...","She is all over the place with her lectures.  She doesn't believe in lesson plans.  In this class she wants you to know all the information from the book and all we did waqs presentations. She taught maybe 4 of the 15 weeks we had class.  She wastes a lot of class time.  She is, however, a fair grader."],"courses":["SPAN376","SPAN376","SPAN300","SPAN377"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":376,"section":1,"class_nbr":3190,"title":"PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0209","days":"MWF","time":"10","instructor":"ESTIGARRIBIA,BRUNO","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":24,"enrl_tot":24,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":2,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1825188","fname":"Bruno","lname":"Estigarribia","quality":"4.5","easiness":"3.5","help":"3.5","clarity":"3.5","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"3.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["Dr. Estigarribia is a very good professor and he did an excellent job bringing in new research in the field of Guarani Linguistics to our class. I definitely try to take courses with this professor, because he can be depended on to help you get a solid foundation in the major. This was one of my favorite courses in my undergraduate career.","Very fair prof. You have to do the work (sometimes there's a lot of it) and know the material, but his exams are very straight-forward and his expectations are generally very clear. He offers extra credit throughout the semester and he is enthusiastic about his subject."],"courses":["SPAN683","SPAN377"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
