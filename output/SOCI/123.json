He's a young PhD student which makes class more relaxed as he relates to students. He shows a lot of video clips, there are group discussions, and the exams are easy if you do the readings. There's a quiz every week, so make sure to stay on top of assignments! Overall, I would definitely retake this class!"],"courses":["SOCI123"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
