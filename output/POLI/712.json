You can tell he knows what he's talking about and he's really good at staying un-biased/not letting his political views affect his teaching. Not too heavy of a workload, the tests and blog posts are very manageable if you put in the time to prepare. I would take this class again, definitely recommend!","Professor Ryan is a really chill dude and while you don't have to go to class, it will affect your participation grade. He doesn't like tests and as such the few he does give are easy and the class is geared mainly toward learning how to do things rather than learning a bunch of random information. Class was loaded with group projects though.","He's a nice guy, fair grader, wants the best for you. Really into the blogs which is the better alternative than the NYT thing with Conover. He doesn't get visibly annoyed, although you can tell he's not happy when half the class doesn't show. (Attendance wasn't necessarily mandatory) You get what you put into the class. Take notes.","Really engaging professor. Took the time to make sure students truly learned the material, and did a great job at not showing personal political affiliation (non-biased). As long as you come to class, you'll be fine. Tests were based mostly on notes and some readings, which wasn't overbearing or uninteresting. No papers, only 2 blog posts."],"courses":["POLI100H","POLI417","POLI100","POLI100"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
