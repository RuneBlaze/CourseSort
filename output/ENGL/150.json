Her lectures are always helpful, and attendance counts so go to class.  She always available through email and responds in timely manner. I learned so much in this class that i use everyday, especially when about resumes, interviews, and business etiquette.","Tough grader and very nit picky, but you learn a ton of stuff in regard to business writing. Most informative class I took my freshman year, but also the class that took the most work","She is very smart and knowledgeable, and I learned a lot about writing from this class. However, she is extremely picky when she grades to the point where it is neurotic. She is nice and a good teacher overall though.","Very friendly teacher.  She is one of the few teachers I know that provides true, quality feedback on papers and assignments.  She truly wants you to understand what you did wrong and how you should correct it. She is very clear with her expectations which is helpful.  She's pretty strict on her rules and is a tough but fair grader.","Prof. Irons is such a good professor! Conversation in the classroom was always well-guided by her and captivating in general!","Susan Irons was one of the worst professors I've ever had at UNC. I love literature, but she was so boring that I hated her class.  Tried to give everything unwarranted psychological analysis.  Never encouraged any useful discussions.  Was incredibly nitpicky about paper format.  There are MANY much better professors in the department.","She was an amazing teacher. You learn a lot of things in this class that are useful in the professional world (memos, letters, cover letters, resumes, research proposals, etc.) I would suggest taking this class even if you aren't interested in business. She is a tough grader but gives you a lot of help. She is incredibly friendly.","Gives an overwhelming amount of material with very little depth or meaningful analysis.  The majority of the writings are mundane, which makes reading them difficult or unenjoyable. Looks for particular responses rather than encouraging openness. Not bad, but not great.  Try J. Thrailkill.","Gives an overwhelming amount of material with very little depth or meaningful analysis.  The majority of the writings are mundane, which makes reading them difficult or unenjoyable.

There is a colossal amount of reading (5 novels plus countless short stories).  Just skim the bad ones (most) and contribute to discussion. There is a 8-10 p. analytical paper worth 25% of your grade, final exam 25%, midterm 20%, biweekly 1-2 page text responses 20%, and attend/partic 10%. Too many texts, too little depth. 4/5.","a wicked woman, incredibly boring - she just went on and on. her readings were way too much. smile a lot, but it's like a dr. jekyl mr.hyde thing going on -- wish i had never taken this class!","Wonderful professor!! Obviously loves what she teaches and is really enthusiastic. She is so sweet and really knowledgeable about American lit. Would take her class again in a heartbeat.","I love Dr. Irons! She is so sweet and loves all her students. She gets so excited when she lectures on her favorite writers such as Emily Dickinson. The reading assignments are a bit ridiculous (some will take 5 + hours to get through), so you'll have to skip a few here and there. Over all though, you must read to do well on the midterm and final.","TAKE WHATEVER CLASS THIS WOMAN TEACHES!  she's wonderfully sweet, approachable, grades very fairly, is engaged, and truly gets to know her students (has all 40 names memorized in the first week).  adorable, wears little jackets with pearls to class every day, knows what she's talking about-is AWESOME!  :0)","Very kind and knowledgable, not too difficult but no pushover either.","I'm a rising junior now and I had her my first class ever at UNC. She is still the best teacher I have had here by far! She is EXTREMELY nice and helpful and is very passionate about what she teaches. I see her on campus now 2 years later and she still remembers my name. Overall a great class and an even better teacher. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","shes in teh english department now."],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL150","ENGL344","ENGL102I","ENGL344","ENGL344","AMER344","ENGL343","ENGL343","ENGL343","ENGLISH28","ENG88","ENGLISH28","BUSI100"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
