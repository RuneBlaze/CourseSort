Lectures are long and he is prone to tangents that won't be on the final. He doesn't respond to emails and most of the grades rely on \"participation\" when he lectures all class. He refers to female students as \"coeds\". Nice guy, but not a great prof.","Just be attentive, ask questions and act like you care, he will take notice. You may have no idea what order you are learning or what he wants, but if you make effort and understand the main concepts of the course you will be fine.","Took a lower level class from him before and he was boring, but in this discussion class, he was very engaging and I learned more in this class than I have from any other in college. If you take him, make sure it's a higher level course.","His lectures are extremely boring, and he tends to ramble about a lot of stuff that will never be on the exam. He also assigns a ton of reading. His exams are open-ended but very easy as long as you understand the main topics he is talking about and go to recitation and class.","He is boring in class and it is hard to keep your attention but in office hours he is very engaging and informative. Easy class though.","Boring class, but not difficult","He deviates from the lecture material and goes off on these off topic, unrelated tangents.  There is NO standard for how he or his TA's grade the exams.  I still can't decide which was less useful, the lecture or the recitation.  I ended up getting a B but left the class with nothing more than  a complete disdain for the field of anthropology.","Beware, he will spend an entire class period rambling off topic, essentially wasting your time. He grades horribly: does not grade on correctness, but on whether or not he likes how you say it. I honestly didn't learn anything from this class.","Lectures have nothing to do with what you are talking about.","One of the easiest classes ive taken at Carolina. Its not the most interesting class (its really boring) but the exam questions are broad so if you are good at writing essay the class should be fairly easy. Just go to recitation and look over the powerpoint slides (which are all online) and you will do fine.","this class was absolutely the most boring class i have ever been to! everyone pretty much looked dead in class because it was that dreadful and no one paid attention...thanks to aim and facebook. and even if you studied and went over his powerpoints and read the book your answers to his tests were never specific enough! so frustrating!","He is not exciting, at all.","His classes were soooo boring! He put way too much info on each slide and over 50 slides per class; when he got close to the end of class he would rush through and skip things.  Not a good professor at all!  In a huge lecture class, he gave open ended questions... how ridiculous!","I loved the way he taught, and he was very enthusiastic about the subject matter.  He posted the notes online, and they were very helpful.  Knowledgable and fair grader.  If you study the power points, you should be fine, and he gives study guides and the tests are not extremely difficult","This class is dreadfully boring. The exam material is not covered well in class. He grades insanely hard, so even if your answers comes straight from the book, you will still get a C+ on his exams","increadibly boring class. tests extremely specific.","The class is extremely boring.  No one actually pays attention to his lectures.  Everyone is either on AIM or on Facebook.  Seriously, if you want a class that is exciting, do not take this class because it is downright opposite of exciting.  Also, his tests can be hard","No Comments","inhumanely boring.","class is so boring. the whole lecture is him reading from his powerpoints, which are put onto blackboard. There's no real reason to go to class. Exams are hard and are free response.

Charles was such a cool (and easy!) teacher and I loved coming to class despite it being my 5th class of the day. His lectures were entertaining because he is so passionate and knowledgeable on the subject. He offers lots of extra credit that add points to your final grade. Super cool!","Reasonably clear lectures, does ramble at times, can be rather boring.  Assigns a lot of reading.  Does not go out of his way to meet students, but will help if you visit his office hours.  Tests are a bit difficult, but he gives extra credit if you attend recitations.  Can be intimidating, but is very fair and reasonable, sometimes funny","Not a very good professor. His lectures are pointless, the textbook and readings are all you need to pass. The only good TA is Eric Thomas, the others are awful and snobby. The lectures are so boring and Price uses vocab he makes off from the top of his head. Plus he makes you buy his own book which is completely irrelevant to the class.","Nice guy but avoid taking him if you can!! I wish I would have read these and taken West instead (who I hear is amazing).  His power points do not make any sense, his test are hard, even when you study and he counts the 2 tests and 1 essay as 90 percent of your grade with no willingness to help if you score badly on one (or both).  AVOID HIM!!!","THE LECTURES ARE VERY INTERESTING. HE MAKES THEM FUN AND IS GENUINELY CONCERNED WITH YOU LEARNING/LIKING THE MATERIAL. HE IS A LITTLE CONFUSING, AND HIS POWERPOINT SLIDES DON'T EXPAND ENOUGH TO TRULY HELP. THE TESTS ARE TOUGH, BUT IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU READ AND RE-READ THEN YOU SHOULD DO FINE.","Dr. Price is a great professor. He is not only passionate about his work, he is also a very nice person. The class was fairly easy and extra credit was offered throughout the semester","Price's lectures are very boring and the tests are unnecessarily hard.  There are so many very long readings that are also very boring.  Would NEVER recommend this class with this professor","There's no point in coming to class. He is confusing and boring and the exams aren't hard but we never learned about anything exciting. His Rastafarian book is horrible and he constantly rants about race.","Typical introductory course. Okay lectures, decent tests, decent textbook. Essays help your grade. To do well, read textbooks and posted readings and review powerpoints.","I dreaded this class. I didnt care about it AT ALL, and that's probs why I came out with a C. After studying my butt off for the first 2 tests and only receiving 80, i started to give up. The tests werent even that hard...it really doesnt make any sense. He never gives the tests back. Gives you extra credit essays, but TAs are sucky graders.","The class was pretty interesting. If you're willing to read all assigned reading thoroughly, you can definitely get an A. Although it's hard not to fall asleep in many lectures, He's very nice and tries to keep students engaged.","Prof. Price is a pretty cool guy.  If you study for his tests, you will do well on them.  STUDY THE ARTICLES, NOT JUST THE BOOK.  He also assigns a book assignment concerning the Rastafari.  Also he gives an option for a huge amount of extra credit.  Plus, the guy has really long dreadlocks.  I got an A in the class, and so can you.","Professor Price is my favorite professor this semester. He is a really cool guy, very down to earth, and I never have a problem staying awake in his class. The lectures are very interesting, as are most of the readings. However, the Rastafarian book was NOT good.","The guy himself is awesome. Real cool outlook, has Rastafarian traits, etc. but he is a complex lecturer...tests are somewhat average if you study. TA's are useless. Didn't take attendance for recitations so I never went. Lectures = boring.","Lectures are boring and hard to follow and take notes. In addition to the textbook, he assigns many additional readings and this long and boring rastafarian book.  However, there is only one paper and it is only 2 pages.  You can also do another paper for extra credit.  Also, all exams are 50 easy multiple choice questions.","I liked the guy, hes a rastafarian guys with 5 ft dreadlocks and i actually found the subject intersting. it changed my outlook on society. never used either book,lost them both. He is hard to follow and is scatterbrained but just show up and take notes on what you can discern from the lectures, you'll be fine. 4 hrs studying prior to test- easy B","ANTH 101 is not Price's forte. He said, on day 1, he hadn't taught 101 in awhile. So I understood the--subpar lectures. BUT, the textbook for 101 is VERY interesting and I would highly recommend taking ANTH 101.  Dr. Price may not be the lecturer for you if you want to be enveloped in class everyday. His class is easy.  I got a B.  Read & study ppt","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  it is terrible, he is SO boring. he rarely uses powerpoint and just gets up there and talks about GOD KNOWS WHAT.  he doesn't really use the book either, so you can't really follow along on your own.  oh, and my TA neither spoke nor understood ANY english...so recitation was a complete and utter waste of my life.","AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!!! Taking this class with Dr. Price will teach you more about racism and the hardships blacks have to endure rather than anything about Anthropology. His lectures are annoying and filled with vocabulary he seemed to create spontaneously. Just don't do it man! Wait to take this course with another teacher!!","He was super boring, hard to follow, and it seemed like he made up the lectures as he went. The class was a waste of my time.

Theres no need to go to class though, you can basically just teach yourself everything based on the powerpoint he posts. Wouldn't take a class with him again","Really cool guy and the class itself was interesting.  He tells lots of interesting stories about his personal stories and always tries to make you laugh and keep you engaged in a big lecture.  The only thing that was frustrating was how specific the tests were.  He gives study guides but they are way different from the tests.  random specifics","Really liked this class! Laid-back atmosphere and West tells great stories about his kids and the field work that he's done. The subject matter was interesting and not difficult. Would definitely take a class with him again!","Probably my favorite class b/c of West. He is very passionate about what he does and it's clearly evident. He's done a lot of field work, so class is interesting b/c he'll have \"West story time\" and never fails to make the class laugh. He assigns readings but I never read and have an A. Go to class and look over powerpoints (all the info is there)","Thor West loves his job and that definitely shows in the classroom. As long as you pay attention and go to class tests aren't that hard. He's so passionate about his work and tells so many little relevant stories that it keeps the lectures interesting.  He's such an interesting person and won't fail to make you laugh during class.","Coolest professor. He loves to tell (relevant) stories about his field work and his kids. He expects participation but it's very easy. Awesome class and he knows the topics and readings","West is great! decided to take ANTH 459 b/c I thought it sounded interesting, not thinking it was too high of a level for my year/major. However, it was my highest grade (A)! Not too much work, just a lot of reading. But he sympathizes when the reading is boring, so dont stress about tough ones. Helps a lot to be a naturally strong writer","West is really nice and enthusiastic about the subject matter. Warning: there is a lot of reading to do in the class, but he doesn't give quizzes. Available for help, only 2 papers and a small presentation and a bigger one. Great guy! I recommend him","Dr. West is a terrific professor. I knew nothing about Africa until I took his class.
