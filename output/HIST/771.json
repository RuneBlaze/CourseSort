He's very smart and sort of funny but he talks very fast and gets off track easily.","Draws the A line at 95, be very cautious about taking a class from him.","Reid is a nice guy in person but his class is pretty tough.  The paper assignments are difficult and expectations are a bit unclear.  The grading on papers is also tough but the tests aren't too bad and he gives the questions before hand.  You also have to read cause half the exams come from the textbook.  Also I had a bad TA so that made it worse.","Professor Reid is very enthusiastic and helpful in person. His lectures are convoluted, but he cracks jokes and they seem to go by pretty quickly. The recitations are *amazing*. Essays are tough but the tests are simple enough, and he gives a generous curve. I would recommend for anyone who wants a better understanding of current events.","Professor Reid is quirky person and is passionate about history. He may not be the best public speaker but he really tries to get students interested. He ended up being my favorite professor this semester. The content the class covers is eye opening and interesting. The class wasn't too hard but it also wasn't easy.","Super boring lectures, then the tests are hardly based on anything he talked about. Memorize a whole bunch of pointless facts (not from the book).  Tough paper assignment in the beginning. Harsh on grading - 5 assessments make up a total of 100 points, so every point missed is a point off your final grade.","EXTREMELY boring lecturer. Has the longest and most convoluted essay prompts I've ever seen. Hard class not because the material is difficult but because he is a bad lecturer and his tests are difficult.","I had Professor Reid for a upper level research and writing seminar and I wouldn't have wanted anyone else. He worked with me to explore a topic that was somewhat unusual, but he encouraged me to pursue it. He is very articulate and I found him very helpful and supportive whenever I asked him about something. Great professor!","His lectures weren't clearly organized and he isn't the best speaker on campus.  Overall, the class isn't that difficult and uses fairly interesting books and films to teach.  If you interested in history or are looking for a class to fill, this isn't a bad option","His lectures are nearly impossible to follow.","choose another professor if u want coherent lectures. If not youll get his stream of conscious which is filled with tangents that dont relate to the topic at hand. He is not a good speaker","A wonderful, helpful professor.","I like the guy a lot, but found his class to be mediocre. Teaches off of books and movies, but still lost my interest.","Awesome professor. There's a good amount of work, but the class is a real learning experience.","Worst lecturer i've ever had. His lectures are disjointed and it feels like you're in a different class every time you go. Weekly quizzes require attendance, often had to read a book  or see a 3 hour film every week. Too much work required for this class for the level it is and none of it is enjoyable. Grading was harsh, multiple long papers.","His fuzzy head (and chest mind you) can distract you from his digressions. He finds it impossible to focus on one topic and follow it through in a logical coherent manner. Instead he meanders through vague themes &quot;stepping back&quot; every other sentence to re-clarify an already simple topic. prepared to do a ton of reading and sleeping in this class.","The class is kinda hard, and a B is to be expected.","Professor Reid definately knows what he's talking about. His lectures are a little jumpy and you have to read and write alot, but you learn so much. The sections are great because of the engaged TA's.","No Comments","Brillant professor, finally a challenge after breezing through high school. Many of my friends in the class thought it was vague or difficult, but that's just because they failed the quizzes on the assigned readings. You have to read things a couple of times to actually absorb the information, not just once the morning of."],"courses":["HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST398","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","HIST140","WORLDSINCE45","HIST18","HIST18","HISTORY","WORLDSINCE45"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
