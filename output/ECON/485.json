She is also always available for office hours and is patience and sincere.","Not a fan of the flipped classroom style. Balaban expects you to come to class understanding what she's gonna talk about. It's very intimidating to ask a \"dumb/basic question\" in front of 200+ people. Some of the TAs are outright idiots. Balaban is smart af, but this is a hard class unless you've had econ before. Go to class is a must, and read!","Balaban uses Poll Everywhere to encourage attendance. While it is not a huge part of your grade going to class is extremely helpful because she works out problems just like the ones that will be on the test. It shows what you really need to know, and if you don't pay attention you'll end up working harder than you had to learning things not tested.","Rita really knows her stuff, and she cares about her students. In this class, you get out what you put in. The poll questions in class are a bit tricky but they really make you delve deep in the material. i feel like I have learned so much from this class.","The pros to taking ECON 101H with Balaban are the small classroom size, a clear set of course expectations, and lots of  practice with problem-solving. However, I didn't really find the flipped-learning style to be that effective... it forced students to spend lots of time digging into the concepts, that could have been saved with in-class lecture.","Great class & professor! I liked the reversed classroom style because it forced me to actually pay attention & learn the material. That way when I went to class, I was engaged by answering the polls. The tests are tricky but doing the practice multiple choice questions will help. Also, recitation helped by reinforcing more difficult concepts.","Rita is now doing a flipped classroom so class is good for practice problems, but its a huge class and not attending won't kill your grade. Most of your grade comes from the two midterms and final, which you definitely need to study a decent amount for. If you watch the videos before class and keep up with the work getting a good grade is managable","Amazing professor! If you do all the assignments and study, there is not reason why you shouldnt do well. Tests arent unreasonable. I didnt do too well because I didnt study, but I really enjoyed her class. She is BRILLIANT! You will have to work hard -- but if you work hard, youll understand the material very well. Her econ videos are great!!","Balaban is great. Had her last semester and I enjoyed the class. I know that ECON101 is the dreaded pre-req for many majors, but Balaban makes it bearable for those who hate it. The class is a flipped class. I am personally not a fan of flipped classrooms, but Balaban does a good job with it.","Class and some concepts can be difficult at times, but Balaban is very thorough and certainly knows her stuff. The math part of this course is very basic, but is can be difficult understanding how certain concepts connect and then applying them new ones. There is a lot of information to learn in this course (can be overbearing), but overall its :)","Professor Balaban was a phenomenal teacher. The flipped classroom is very effective with her class, because it allows you to go more in depth and work through examples in class. If you keep up with the work, it is not hard (but I wouldn't say it's an easy A).","Rita is great and cares about her students! You really have to be on top of your work. Make sure you either read or watch the videos (both is not necessary) and don't get behind. If you study for the tests you'll do fine (all multiple choice). Biggest help in preparing for the tests are the attached multiple choice that correspond to the chapter.","A very knowledgeable teacher, Balaban can teach economics. It gets boring to come to class and hear her talk about what you already learned online, though. Tests are very tricky, so you have to study hard to do well. Never get behind on material.","I love Rita! The flipped class might be difficult to adjust to at first, but you'll soon realize how much it helps you deeply understand and critically think about the material. I came into this class knowing nothing about economics, and now I love it. She's tricky on tests, but you can ace 'em if you can conquer the heavy workload and study hard.","Balaban is a solid econ prof. Really learned a lot from her. Tests are harder than the practice she gives you (but not crazy). Expect some test questions that approach topics in ways not explicitly worked out in class (but are totally doable if you understand underlying concepts). I took Honors though so my tests may have been harder than normal.","Good instructor, tough to pull out an A. She goes over material well","In ECON 101 she uses a flipped classroom. I did well with this because I have a hard time being self-disciplined enough to do practice problems on my own. She keeps you fairly busy for the semester but I think it's very helpful.","Flipped classroom style. Works problems in class in addition to lecturing, videos outside of class.","Really knows what she is talking about and a good amount of resources but makes things (tests) way tougher and more advanced than necessary.","Prof. Balaban is extremely hard to understand. She uses the flipped-classroom method and takes full advantage of that. You are expected to have mastered the material before coming to class, and she is not at all accessible to answer questions during lecture. Poll quizzes are given everyday."],"courses":["ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101H","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101H","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101H","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101","ECON101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWFUL"]}}]
