She is a very tough grader, and this class is the reason why I am no longer a French Minor. But as a professor, she is willing to meet outside of class, and she is usually accommodating if assignments need to be turned in late. Take this class if you're very good at French, but pick someone else if you want a good GPA!","The homework and in class material feel ridiculously easy compared to tests and quizzes.  Basically never stop studying, if you fall behind at all you won't be able to catch up.  The highest grade received in my class was a B+","I learned a great deal about French grammar in this class and she was overall an effective teacher, but as a person, she's the worst. If you get sick or have any excuse whatsoever for not completing an assignment on time, even with advanced notice, she will not tolerate it.","I think she is a awesome teacher and I really enjoy learning from her but her test are so hard. I am struggling to pass her class and I have been working really hard. If you fall behind early then there is no catching up!","She gives A LOT of homework for 102. BEWARE!!!!","I still have mixed feelings about this class. The immersion is great in theory, however, most of it was just complex (for that time) linguistics. We listened to almost no French conversation in class and Madam Furry does not enunciate. So imagine talking about linguistics for an hour in French with a person that is hard to hear. I don't even know.","Furry is awesome - she doesn't give many A's, but her class is clearly organized and the progression of the semester is very well thought-out. She has a scary rep, but she's actually funny and very nice. She will whip your grammar into shape, and I feel infinitely more confident in French now. This is exactly how a French grammar course should be.","Unorganized grammar review, grudge that I speak Spanish&#63; Class time spent talking about stories only no grammar. Time used poorly;  Very little instruction. Horrible experience. She expects near- perfection proficiency. Waste of time. She seems to laugh at students errors.  AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS!!!!","Dr. Furry definitely knows her stuff, and 300 is a good class for people seeking lots of feedback on their writing. She's a tough grader, but she also gives a lot of time to complete her short writing assignments.  My complaint was the use of in-class time (3x/wk), which usually consisted of unorganized grammar review that I found unproductive.","Furry really wants you to know French...and know it well. Thus, her grading is extremely tough. You have to work your butt off for an A-. There is a fair amoutn of work...but its not over the top. She will spend countless hours helping you understand. Your French really will improve, but usually at the cost of yoru GPA.","Dr Furry expects a lot from her students and can be a difficult, but fair, grader.  She's fun, and unlike the other commenter said, showed a great deal of interest and knowledge of French culture (must depend on the course).  Everyone liked her, even those that didn't do as well.","She's technically very good (ie. at grammar) but no fun and little real sense of the culture.  Boring, but effective for non-creative subjects like FREN 55.","She's really good at correcting pronunciation and grammar, and her classes are interesting, and her grading fair."],"courses":["FREN300","FREN101","FREN300","FREN101","FREN102","FREN200","FREN300","FREN204","FREN300","FREN255H","FREN23","FREN55","FREN55"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
