And, he is more than willing to provide assistance when material is confusing. I'd take anything he taught.","Not the most exciting lecturer, but he is very nice and helpful. He uses powerpoints but doesn't put notes on them. So you have to listen up in lecture. Exams and papers were reasonable. Be sure to take advantage of office hours. There is a lot of information to absorb in this class.","This was one of my favorite classes at UNC. His lectures were interesting and he's a funny guy. Tests are based on the recitation readings and his lectures, not so much on the textbooks.

The hardest part about it was sitting through the 2 and a half hour discussions on the movies we watched the previous class. Very easy to get a good grade, there are 3 papers due throughout the semester comprising 40% of grade and the final is open everything and she gives you the questions ahead of time.","Conover was a great lecturer. She's knowledgeable, funny, and very explicit about what she expects from you. Her lectures were straightforward, interesting and she sent out study guides in advance so that you could prepare for the tests way ahead of time without any curveballs. I would definitely take another class with her!","I took this class so that I could learn about US government. I actually ended up learning about current social issues. This class doesn't have that much outside work and not really any homework because you don't actually have to read all of the NYT's articles she assigns. I would take this class with a different prof. She curved my test grade down.","This class was more difficult than I expected, and if I had looked on this site, I would not have taken it. The grading scale is tough, the lectures are boring. The class is centered around the New York Times and you actually have to pay for a weekly subscription. The recitations are good, and getting a good TA is important for passing.","She isn't a terrible teacher but she's not great either. Definitely one of those middle aged people that thinks our generation and technology are ruining the world. Her lectures, while not particularly engaging or interesting, are clear. Lectures are optional but  go and take notes on what she says, not just her powerpoints. Required NYT reading.","She is very politically inclined and that is made clear in her teaching. I had a hard time expressing my own opinions in the small group setting.","This class was by no means easy, but her lectures were very engaging, and if you do your work, you can surely get an A. Getting a good TA really matters and participating in recitation discussions helps your grade (and it wouldn't hurt to take notes during them). I had Mr Petrash and he was great. But go to lectures and take good notes for sure!","Not very understanding at all.","Watching movies is great and this class is not hard at all, but once Conover starts to lecture, I lose all interest. She teaches like a high school teacher, has the least helpful power points imaginable, and will shut down anyone's ideas that do not align with hers. It's not a hard class at all, but I just can't handle her as a professor.","I think if I were to have read some of the most recent ratings before I took this class, I wouldn't have taken it and would have missed out on a great class. Granted, this class is far from an easy A, but Conover knows what she is talking about and if you put in the work you will reap the benefits.","Go ahead and switch your professor now. Interesting course, but she is really tough. Lectures are somewhat interesting, but the amount of work you put in outside the classroom is ridiculous. Instead of being graded on your New York TImes comprehension level, read it for fun and switch to an easier professor.","Hated this class.  Lectures are actually fairly interesting but are biased and have nothing to do with the rest of the class. The exams and papers are completely based off of the NY Times, which makes it more difficult.  Would NOT recommend this professor.","Connover's class on the surface is very simple. I went into the first exam with a high level of confidence and left with the same amount. I thought I aced the test no questions about it. I was shocked when I received a 68. TA do everything and are the most strict graders I have EVER experienced. Run for the hills if you receive Martin Caver. Horrid","She gives good lectures, but that's about the extent of what's good about taking her class. The class in general is very hard and time consuming. Work for her class includes reading the NYT (which all papers and tests are based on), 2 exams, 2 papers, 4 quizzes, and  online discussions. Don't take this class if you already have a tough schedule.","Interesting lectures, clear and organized. I don't understand why EVERYTHING has to be taken from NYT for papers and exams. Worst part of this course is you have to pass 3/4 book quizzes (which are pretty difficult) to even get at least a B+","Unless you want to pay for a New York Times article and learn somely about ONLY the NYT, DON'T TAKE THE CLASS. Conover knows her stuff and the lectures are fairly interesting, but outside lecture the only thing you do is talk about the NYT. All exams and papers are based only on the NYT. I honestly left the class knowing the same as when i started.","Conover does know her stuff, but she is biased. I came into the class wanting to major in poli sci, but changed my mind after the class. There are only 4 graded assignments, and when I took it, the TA graded unfairly. I think she's a great teacher, but the class is too hard to do well.","Before finalS I was in the hospital. I made plans to retake it. Conover emailed me saying come either tuesday or thursday during office to retake it. I was back home and out of state so I emailed her back thursday and she didn't reply. When I arrived she cussed me out saying I was stupid to come when she didn't respond. HORRIBLE PERSON AND TEACHER!","Pamela Conover is a horrid professor. She knows her stuff, but she's so biased that I found it hard to take anything she said seriously. I learned a lot about how George Bush is the devil, and how the evil white man is continuing to keep everyone else down. I was going to major in poli before I took this course. Conover changed my mind.","Professor Conover knows her stuff. Keeps class engaging. Never thought I would like poli sci but she changed my mind.

Politics is my thing, philosophy isn't, but professor Spinner is an amazing lecturer and overall instructor. Very passionate about what he teaches and makes you think and question everything. He's tough though, so get ready to read and study. The class is doable, but you have to be willing to work hard.","Dr. Spinner is honestly one of the best teachers I have had. Although the reading was dense and difficult to understand, the class discussion made it so that we knew what the important parts were. He assigns papers more than tests, take into account improvement, and gives honest, constructive criticism. You should be willing to put in the effort.","Professor Spinner is amazing. I loved this course! But it is not for the lazy student. You have to read, and you have to come to class. But do it! A really good class.","I feel like I learned a great deal in this class, but the TA grading is very inconsistent and the smallest of errors may eliminate any chance you had of getting an A. Tons of reading, though I sort of liked it because I had always wanted to read the great political philosophers but lacked the motivation. Take only if very interested in the subject.","Unclear lectures and unclear readings are individually not enough to ruin a class but this is one situation where the two meet. Expect excessive amounts of what feels like unnecessary reading because even when you do it it's entirely possible to misconstrue it and get screwed on an essay or exam. Take if you need to but don't expect a fun time.","Difficult course, huge amounts of reading; most of which is dry and, at times, beyond comprehension. Still, Prof Spinner will offer you extra help if you ask him for it. He does come off as intimidating, but in the end, he bent over backwards to help me through the course material. NOT for slackers.","Definitely a difficult class.  Don't take this just to knock off a gen. ed requirement.  That's what I did, but luckily I realized I really enjoyed the material.  I learned a lot.  Take this if you genuinely have an interest in the subject.  Professor Spinner-Halev's lectures get redundant but he knows what he's talking about.  Overall a good guy.","This class was extremely, extremely difficult. I mistakenly took this class my first semester of my freshman year...DO NOT repeat this egregious mistake. I struggled initially, but I actually performed well overall. My TA saved my grade...I went to her during office hours for help nearly every day. Work in groups for these exams.","This class was insanely difficult. The teacher talks incredibly fast so be ready to type. Attendance is not mandatory but you better go or have notes from someone in the class. The reading is difficult with about different authors who all have similar concepts you must be able to recall. The TA's grade all tests and papers-they are extremely picky!","Spark Notes will not save you when it comes to this class. You better be prepared to do some serious reading (in old-school language!) Also, the grading on papers and exams was ridiculous.","Although lecture attendance is not required, if you plan on doing well in the class, lecture is extremely helpful.  Professor Spinner-Halev does a nice job of explaining the confusing theoretical concepts, especially when it comes to digesting the dense amount of reading material assigned.  The TA's grade the work and can be nit-picky graders.","The class itself was definitely difficult, but I thought that he was very good at explaining complicated concepts. You definitely need to go to lecture to understand the readings and know what the main points are. I thought that exams and papers were tough but were graded fairly.","Don't take this class if you don't like to do readings or speak in class discussions because that's all this class is. Dr. Spinner-Halev is extremely knowledgeable and leads the discussions well but the class content comes from the class. He does seem to acknowledge that the subject matter is quite complicated and is a very fair grader.","Tons of reading.He keeps the lectures about as interesting as you can make modern philosophy.All the grading is done by TAs though;I got a bad one and ended up with horrible grades while my friends turned in comparable work to other TAs and got 95s and higher.Went to him for help once and he was very helpful, although he comes off as intimidating.","The tests and papers aren't so much difficult, but they are graded extremely toughly.  A 90 is as high as it gets on any assignment (no matter how good it is), but the TAs do all the grading. The prof was very helpful when I went to see him though.

If you pay attention and do the readings you'll see how he compares governments & countries. A good TA helps too.","Reynolds is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, but there didn't seem to be clear takeaways from his powerpoints and lectures. It felt more like a history class than comparative politics. Readings are long and boring.","He is amazing!  An incredibly interesting person and a great lecturer.  I enjoyed the class and it has been one of my favorites at UNC.  I would highly recommend, even if you are not a Political Science major.","Super nice guy, makes an otherwise boring subject pretty interesting. The british accent doesn't hurt too. The tests were straight forward and consistent, I got a B+ and never did the readings and never studied more than an hour for the tests.","This class was very interesting. There were also essentially no readings and only two five-page essays. The grading is sketchy, though: it seems geared toward giving everyone a B and making it very hard to get an A.","Reynolds was obviously very experienced in his subject, and that definitely showed during his lectures. However, I really expected this class to be more about comparative political systems, when it seemed like a history lecture every day. Readings are boring and long, and Reynold's powerpoints are not always clear and he does not post them.","Great teacher. Engaging, really values learning over grades/tests. Concerned with big picture stuff, not nitty gritty details. Really, really knows his stuff. Cool guy, very fair and reasonable. Readings are not included on exams. If you attend lecture exams are pretty straight forward. Not trying to trick you.

Reynolds keeps lectures entertaining and his accent doesn't hurt. ;)","Really great class and he does it in a very interesting way. Readings are helpful but it is not necessary to read too thoroughly.","Professor Reynolds' class was very interesting and his lectures were exciting or at least easy to follow.  There is virtually no homework; grades come from three exams and an essay and there is no textbook, but online readings instead.  Highly recommended if you want to learn more about different political systems around the world.","He keeps lectures pretty interesting and jokes around a lot.  Tests aren't really hard, just long.  Fifty minutes is definitely not enough time to write six paragraphs and a clear essay.  There's also a lot of reading involved, but going to recitation helps you understand.","Wonderful teacher.

Grade consists of Mid Term, Final, Research Paper, and Recitation participation.","Interesting course material, but Professor Huber tends to be dry.  She does not allow laptops and lectures from a powerpoint every class.  The exams are somewhat detailed but not difficult if you come to lecture and pay attention.  She does grade on a curve, based on how the TA's grade you.  I would recommend this course only to POLI majors.","Pros: She is clearly an expert in her field and is good at explaining things. Cons: Lectures could get kind of boring and we couldn't use laptops, which made it challenging to take notes because she talks kind of fast. Overall, this class is difficult but I would still recommend her as a professor.","Avoid at all costs.","She was a good Prof.  The class could get pretty boring, but she tried.  She is most def one of those people that would probably do better in a small class.  The exams and pop quizzes are that hard as long as you do the reading.

I wish he taught more undergrad courses because I would definitely take a class from him again. There is a lot of reading but it's usually very interesting. Go to office hours at least once or twice.","He just follows his powerpoints- what elaboration he does add is really wordy and typically doesn't make sense.","I loved this class and the professor even more. His lectures, though sometimes boring, are well planned so you can easily follow the subject matter. Your grade is based on 3 kinda tricky multiple choice tests, but if you read the posted articles (that are actually interesting most of the time) and discuss in recitation, a B+/A- is easy to obtain.","Really enjoyed this class because I really enjoyed the subject matter.

Study the notes and skim the required books and you can pull a solid B.","I stopped going to his class b/c it was better to sleep that extra hour in my bed than in Hamilton 100 and he put the notes on blackboard.  What could have been made into interesting subject matter just wasn't.","I never went to class and still did pretty good.  I would really suggest just reading the lecture notes before the exam and try hard in the recitations.  They are pretty useless but can hurt you if you don't work hard.","Some may find him tantalizing. The recitations are worthless and so are the lectures. Just study the notes the week before the exam and read the books or get a review of the books online.","stimson is one of my favorite profs-- he has a good personality and makes an introductory class really intersting. definitely knows his stuff, and the tests are really easy. take his class!","He is one of the best profs I had. Creative, innovative approach to his subject. Great books. Easy tests. Interesting lectures. Fun personality. Seems to know everything. You leave the course with a great, complex insight into American Politics and how we, the public, indirectly shape it! Luvd it!","great teacher. Very smart. Classes are pretty boring but he posts notes online and they are really clear, helpful and interesting...i would def recommend him and his class"],"courses":["POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI401","POLI100","POLI100","POLI41","POLI41","POLI41","POLISCI40ISH","POLI41","POLI41","POLI41","POLI41","POLI041"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":993,"section":72,"class_nbr":5538,"title":"MASTER'S RESEARCH AND THESIS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"BAUMGARTNER,FRANK R.","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2110893","fname":"Frank","lname":"Baumgartner","quality":"4.5","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"BEWARE OF POP QUIZZES (2)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["CARING","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA"],"comments":["This class has been my favorite class at UNC so far.

If you get a chance you should definitely tour the prison. If you don't read the books for the class you'll be lost the whole time - they are vital.","VERY INTERESTING! Class is lecture style. He posts the ppts online, but go to class because there are pop quizzes. There are mandatory speaker events every week outside of the class (so it's a big time commitment). There are 2 papers, 1 final, pop quizzes, and recitation grade. Definitely recommend. I learned a lot.

She is disorganized, doesn't clarify what's on the tests and does not help in office hours and is forcing you out as soon as you walk in.","This class is not too difficult if you go to the lectures.  She goes everything from the readings that you need to know in the lectures and the recitations were helpful.  She can talk a bit fast, but her lectures are very comprehensive and helpful to doing well in the class.","Professor Martinez Gallardo can talk a little fast at times, but she is trying to cover a lot of material for POLI 238. Her lectures were generally clear and easy to follow. She is a solid, average professor and I would recommend her and her class to a friend. Nothing very negative or very wonderful to say about her.","I don't know why everyone gives her such a negative review. Honestly, CMG is an excellent professor, scholar, and and lecturer. I loved her class.","Scattered, disorganized, rambling. Sure she's nice and friendly, but boy is she a bad teacher.","I really enjoyed my 238 class with this professor.  She lectures with energy and is very knowledgeable about the topic.  Also, she's very kind to students.  I highly recommend this professor.","She is very much focused on key concepts and points, so if she makes sense to you then there isn't much need to do the reading (except for participation). Spend time on the essays, they count for a lot and help you understand the content better. Given the broad and slightly dull subject, I still enjoyed the class overall because of her and the TAs.","Overall, I liked her. She is extremely friendly and helpful. Some parts of her lectures were unclear to people, but the textbook helped clarify things tremendously. TAs were great too. Papers were easy, but the exams were pretty tough. If you want to take Poli 238, take it with Cecilia.","I was kind of excited for this class, but her lectures are really scattered. The TAs overall were good, the class was curved, and it was relatively easy, but expectations are very unclear. Not a very good class, overall.","I was so excited to take this class. Unfortunately, I learned nothing from her. Thankfully her TA's were good. Her exam grading rubrics are ridiculous. This class is a pretty easy B, but you wont learn much because her lectures are terrible and irrelevant to LA Politics. So disorganized and unclear expectations."],"courses":["POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
