However, I was really disappointed in the class because we didn't end up following the syllabus, and we didn't seem to do any real work until the final project. She is very vague about her expectations, and didn't return any grades throughout the semester, which made me nervous about my standing in the class","She's an accomplished artist and has made some great work but admittedly doesn't want to teach and this blas√© attitude is evident in her lack of syllabi, unclear instructions, non-existent due dates, and spotty class attendance. As a one-on-one advisor, she can be very helpful. Unfortunately, she is the only sculpture professor at UNC."],"courses":["ARTS103","ARTS253","ARTS290"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR"]}},{"subject":"ARTS","catalog_nbr":103,"section":1,"class_nbr":7857,"title":"CORE CONCEPTS: SPACE","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Art Laboratory","room":"0120","days":"MW","time":"08","instructor":"Smith,Emily Jordan","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["VP"],"enrl_cap":14,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1666905","fname":"Emily","lname":"McKendry-Smith","quality":"5.0","easiness":"1.5","help":"1.5","clarity":"1.5","topTag":"","grade":"1.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["Emily is a wonderful teacher and person.

Her explanation of required reading material through lectures is exceptional.  Work load is not too high and she seems to be a fairly easy grader.  I truly enjoyed this course, but only because Emily taught it."],"courses":["SOCI130","SOCI251"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
