The textbook is online and a complete waste of money. When you do the reading quizzes there is no way to check your answers until he posts them (which is not until the test comes around). He also refuses to let you make up an exam, even when you are excused for university functions. DO NOT take him.","He teaches out of this horrendous online textbook. His tests are out to trick you. In office hours, he is not particularly helpful to students. Lectures are pointless and he is not very good at explaining things","I was not looking forward to taking this class because I am not really interested in ecology or evolution, but Dr. Hurlbert is a great professor and is very good at keeping students engaged and makes sure we understand the material. Very helpful in lectures and in office hours. Tests are hard: aren't very many questions but are straight-forward.","Hurlbert is possibly the worst professor I have ever had.  He comes across as very patronizing, and his test questions have multiple correct answers, but its whichever one he feels is right. He tests out of the book on things not from lecture, which is ridiculous since there is so much reading.","This professor is the most boring professor you will ever have, especially if you are not interested in the material. He does not use the textbook at all so you have to go to every class and take extensive notes to get a good grade on his section of the exams. This class is on a curve so the exams are way harder than they need be so the curve is up","The professor should be nicer in office hours, however there is not a correlation between what he teaches in class which he teaches in class which superb; however,if you approach up to him for a question he answers your question with a question and tells you that you should know not only the material discussed in class but also in the textbook.","The professor is great in class lectures but is not very friendly in office hours when you ask questions pertaining to what you should focus. Today I went to his office and he treated me like I should not be in his course. It was just a bad experience and would warn people on the types of questions you ask. This was not a great experience.","Probably one of the most approachable professors at Carolina.  Definitely a very smart guy, although sometimes what he says might go over your head a little bit, but he is very nice and helpful.","Professor Hurlbert is AMAZING!  He is the best Bio Professor I have had at UNC!  He was on Franklin Street jumping Fires after we won during the Final Four.  He is really an amazing lecturer.  He is so interesting.  His test wasn't bad.  The average was higher than the first part of the course.  I cannot say enough how amazing he is!"],"courses":["201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
