His class is discussion style and almost completely run by the students. He does expect you to read just about every night and submit a reading log. The toughest part was how boring and confusing some of the readings were! McGowan is awesome, but the reading selections weren't","I had him for a first-year seminar and it was absolutely amazing. He's the best professor I've had to date and is very forgiving, doesn't throw the book at you just because he can.","Dr. McGowan is terrific.  He is my favorite professor at UNC.  If you pass up a class of his, you are missing out.","A very engaging, shrewd, and yet also self-effacing professor.  You get the impression there's nothing he hasn't already read.  He's an extremely eloquent lecturer capable of making very abstract topics seem graspable.  A tough grader on papers, but reasonable.  I wouldn't hesitate to take another of his classes."],"courses":["CMPL123","ENGL54","ENGL150","CMPL251"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"HNRS","catalog_nbr":396,"section":10,"class_nbr":11498,"title":"INDEPENDENT STUDIES","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"Steinwand,Blaire Janell","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1684341","fname":"Blaire","lname":"Steinwand","quality":"3.0","easiness":"3.7","help":"3.7","clarity":"3.7","topTag":"Tough Grader (24)","grade":"3.7","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["TOUGH GRADER","CARING","ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","TOUGH GRADER","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","SKIP CLASS?

Also, she is never wrong, so do not contradict her.  Not the best choice to learn.","One of the best professors I've ever had!! Her class is tough but interesting and once you get to the upper level classes you'll be glad you had her. Plus she gives you a bunch of resources to do well as long as you put the work in on your end you'll do well. She's very kind and helpful in office hours too. Absolutely would recommend.","I think the problem is that Professor Steinwand doesn't understand how difficult her exams are. I would study so much, not even cramming, and still make right at or even below the average. It was very hard to understand what many of the questions were asking and not having practice tests didn't help either. Try to get someone else if possible.","I don't like the course style of our biology department actually, too much meaningless thing actually distract me from learning it. And the professor cannot measure the toughness of test at all, which sometimes become super easy and sometimes become super hard. And the knowledge point which we should study is like super vague.","Teaches at a very elementary level with simple examples and very surface level lectures and many complain that the tests are unfair because of their difficulty and length. However, I feel like you can get used to the style of questions. If you do the SI problems and go through the PPT examples, you'll be fine on the tests. Didn't learn much overall","I took this as a freshman and it was my first Bio class at UNC, do not make this your first bio class here! I did terrible on the 1st exam, mediocre on the 2nd, and phenomenal on the 3rd. The amount I studied for each exam didn't change and the class average didn't really change either; you just have to get used to her type of tests.","One of the worst teachers I have ever seen. Her way of grading tests and asking test questions is bad. In lecture, she will show you a \"practice question\" and you'll see something similar only to find out that there is some kind of trick involved. If something seems easy on an exam, you're doing it wrong. This may seem biased, but do not take her.","i'm sure she's a great person but she sucks so much as a professor. Her exams are unfair and she wastes class time going over trivial stuff then tests you on things you've never gone over. Tests are way too long for the allotted time and you spend half your time trying to understand what she is asking.","Great teacher, but DOESN'T WRITE FAIR EXAMS. The exams are designed to trick you instead of test your knowledge of the material, so it doesn't matter how much you study. Test questions are based off of things she very briefly mentions and not practice problems or what she spends the most time on.","Her GRQs and even exams are riddled with spelling mistakes. She projects the material in a very simple fashion and then expects you to integrate the knowledge into analytical questions on the exam. This would be fine, were it not for the confusing and ambiguous nature of the tests and their answers. I would recommend finding a different teacher.","If you like working in groups and discussions, you will love this class. If you like traditional lecturing classes, this professor might not be for you. Like everyone has said before me, her exams are tough but in my opinion reasonably fair.","In lecture it feels like all of the concepts are really easy and then she makes the tests far more challenging compared to the depth of lecture.","I loved Dr. Steinwand's class. You definitely have to do the reading ahead of time to know what's going on in class, but it's totally worth it. A large portion of the tests are experimental design, but it makes the tests better because you learn how to apply the concepts you're learning. And Dr. Steinwand is super clear and a great professor!!","Tests are so hard and not based off of what you cover in class or the reading. DO NOT TAKE HER. Her outlines seem helpful but she tries to claim a stern title as a newbie in the Bio department. She assigns grades based off of what type of student she thinks you are.","Dr. Steinwand is truly a genuine teacher. She works so hard to work with and help students. She's not an easy teacher by far - you have to be prepared to do work on your own. But she makes that clear and she supplements all that you learn on your own with important knowledge on applying what you learn. Overall an amazing mentor and professor!","205 is my second class with Dr. Steinwand and I had her for 202. She is nice, but she treats her classroom as an elementary style classroom.  Her lectures seem simple and watered down, but her concept of applying the material makes her tests difficult and ambiguous. Oh, and don't challenge her exam questions or she will bite your head off.","The flipped classroom can be a great thing. This professor does not do the flipped classroom well at all. The material is challenging enough without having to show up to class already having internalized it. EVERYTHING is a group activity. NOTHING is explained in lecture. A \"70\" is a \"good average exam grade.\" Spare yourself.","Steinwand is awful. Her tests are extremely hard and are basically designed to trick you. She's very unhelpful in office hours and even less helpful in lecture. She rushes through material and often answers questions by saying \"find it in your textbook.\"","Never had more mixed feelings about a teacher. A very forthcoming lady--she invited us over to her house for dinner and really seemed to enjoy getting to know our individual interests relevant to the course. However, her harsh grading will surprise you, and unless you study for the exams in a very \"Steinwand-specific way\" you will struggle.","She is so great to students. I consider her a mentor for life. So glad I took her class. I'm a transfer student and learned a lot about studying and how caring people at Carolina are through her. Organized. Gives a ton of resources.
