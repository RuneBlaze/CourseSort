Definitely not a good class to take for your PH credit. He makes an effort to post many course materials online though, which saves a lot of money.","He's an entertaining lecturer, and the class is pretty straightforward. I got away with not doing most readings, but I never skipped lectures. The papers are graded harsh, but the tests are all multiple choice. It's a lot of work and the writings are really dry, but it's not impossible. The tests contain mostly lecture and recitation material.","Frequently lectures on only a very small portion of the very significant assigned readings. He didn't really know much about Marx, which was disappointing, but still managed to avoid most major errors. Tests are all multiple-choice (and papers count very little) and when not very tricky, are on useless information. TAs make those though, I believe.","Interesting class, but difficult. TAs and recitation very important for understanding and comprehending course material.","An odd one to evaluate. He lives in large lecture  halls, so it's impossible to get to know him. He's a big name in his field. I was reading a Mann story the other day and noticed he was the translator. He's a decent teacher, if aloof. It is fun to hear him translate from Latin, Ancient Greek, German, and French though. Warning: he will curve DOWN!","I don't recommend him unless you're especially interested in philosophy.  The exams are relatively difficult, though not impossible.  He's not always so clear and it's hard to anticipate what will be on them.  Not to mention he curved our first exam grades DOWN.","Great lecturer, has a knack for making very difficult subject matter easier to understand. Its a good thing, for most people german philosophy is pretty hard to understand. Grades are run by TAs- can be pretty hit or miss (mine was fine). I worked hard but don't regret taking the class.","Very interesting professor, knows a lot about his subject. The lectures are very interesting, but it's your job to keep on top of them. Don't be expected to be handed everything on a silver platter. Also, don't fall back on your readings. The TAs aren't that great, they try to do their thing and it doesn't work. Highly recommended class.","He makes boring stuff fairly interesting!","Witty, insightful and wonderful at condensing and clarifying material in lecture, but..lectures and reading don't correspond with each other, paper topics are poorly defined, and TAs are inept. It's extremely frustrating experience, but the class is actually not that hard.","There is no discussion in class; he shows up late, lectures, and leaves five minutes early.  He has unattainable standards regarding what constitutes &quot;H&quot; work, and he doesn't stick to those standards.  Otherwise, this is really not a graduate caliber course.  An easy, albeit frustrating, &quot;P&quot; course.","The material on the tests was unexpected by most of the students and the recitation leaders did little to help.  The lectures were good and clarified the readings well, however, the tests seemed to contain some rather trivial, unexpected questions which made studying difficult.","You read one thing, he teaches another, and you're tested on a third.  He does not hold office hours and the recitation leaders do little to help.  The tests are interpretive but are multiple choice so you can't justify your answer.  Horrible class and professor.","lectures really help clarify some of the dense readings, and he throws in a few funny comments along the way. there's a good bit of reading, but you learn a lot."],"courses":["GERM246","GERM245","GERM245","GERM246","CMPL120","GERM245","GERM246","GERM245","GERM050","GERM55","CMPL242","GERM50","GERM50","GERM50"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
