Great professor! He could be a really cool uncle!","An absolutely amazing professor. Extremely entertaining, knows the material, and is more than happy to help out and clarify when a subject or topic isn't quite clear. Has a great personality and is very personable and enjoys interacting with students. If given the opportunity, you should take a class with this professor.","Hands down the best professor I've ever had. This is the second course I've had with him and both were amazing. He takes great interest in the material. He goes deep with concepts so you really understand them instead of trying to cover an entire book. Very clear and helpful. Tests aren't bad at all - some multiple choice, some problems.","Probably the only grad class I ever took where I never - not once - left class confused.  Any momentary confusion of quickly cleared up with a well answered question.  It's not that the class was easy - he just explains things so well.  And he takes a real interest in his students.  One of the best profs I've ever had.","Great professor! Really cares that the student understands the concepts. Tests are kinda hard but he tests on exactly what he teaches, nothing extra. Definitely go to class, don't bother with the book. One of the best professors I've had at UNC!","No Comments","Easy tests if you understand the basic concepts but tough homework and subject matter. Attendance not required but missing class is generally bad. Truly loves his field and explains things as clearly as possible. be prepared to sit through some intense math at times though. Excellent prof overall."],"courses":["PHYS054","PHYS54","PHYS128","PHYS861","PHYS104","5","PHYS28"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
