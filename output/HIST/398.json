Expert in his field. I took it over the summer, so no TA's. Midterm was 40%, final was 60%. Very strict grader. For the text, read HIS books (that he wrote)..... you'll learn much more than the assigned readings.","I had Professor Barney for a Civil War course at Trenton State College (now The College of New Jersey)in 1975.  Almost 40 years and 3 master degrees later, Professor Barney still ranks as one of my best professors ever.  (And I am happy to report that my youngest daughter will be a freshman this year at Gettysburg College! What irony!!).","He knows the Civil War inside and out, which I thought would be good, but the entire class was just horrendously boring blow-by-blow details of every single battle, troop movement, shot fired, etc. Definitely taught as a PWAD and not a HIST class. Also does not touch on Reconstruction at all, so no clue why that's in the course title.","knowledgeable but terrible teacher. grades papers like hes pissed off and doesnt give advice on them. avoid this guy","Fantastic Professor.  I enjoyed his lectures, and I actually thought that he was very entertaining.  The two midterms are graded by TA's, so if you have a good one like I did, it is possible to succeed.  However, the final is graded by Barney, and he is a Stickler.  You are given the material for the test prior to the test, so STUDY IT ALL!","Dr. Barney rocks! He knows everything about American history and includes really insteresting details in his lectures. Two of the three tests are graded by TAs, so prepare for the final really well because he grades very harshly. This is the most interesting class I've taken at Carolina!","Engaging speaking who loves what he teaches.  Mid-term and Final only -- but very difficult if you are not prepared, and it is critical that you do well on the exams as there is nothing else to off-set your grade.  Makes himself available if you have questions or need help.  Great class!","An interesting and engaging lecturer. You can really tell he loves what he's teaching and he passes it on to his students. The tests are hard, but if you study enough and pay attention in recitations you'll do well. NOT impossible to get an A.","Dr. Barney looks like he stepped right out of the Civil War and his personality fits what he teaches. He can be very interesting at times and very dull at other times. I took his class on the Civil War and he wrote the book which matched his lectures almost word for word. It is an easy class if you are happy with a B it is difficult to get an A.","Class is a challenge, but he is a good professor. Lectures well, I found the subject matter engaging. 1 essay and 2 big tests make up all of your grade, can really be sink or swim. He will give you review guides beforehand, go to the review session held by the TA and study hard. He grades all his finals, TA splits work otherwise.","Barney was a great lecturer, IMO. Much of his grading is done by his TAs so it depends on them. He grades the final and it's hard to determine what he expects because that's all he grades. He gives you test questions in advance and the material is almost all covered in lecture.","Very strict on grading, much of which is done by TA's. Mine was very tough, making taking this class a regret.","This older man is a wealth of information, and has written countless history texts, read the book he assigns (and wrote himself)..BUT his lectures lend themselves to dozing off. Three essay style tests- its IMPOSSIBLE to earn an A.","He knows his stuff, and lectures from start to finish. But he's a stickler, and his TAs determine the grades.","He knew the material, but his TAs give B.S. grades and the class is ridiculously boring. If you take this class, you don't need to go to class, but you do need to be able to write well and a lot on your tests.","BARNEY RULES! I had never learned so much History in my whole life. Mostly political view. He lectures every second of the class and so keep up with the notes and GO TO CLASS. 3 noncumulative essay tests in the semester. Text book will save your life. I highly recommend any of his classes.","Very interesting class, you learn a lot, about things you never have thought about.  But, the tests require a lot of preparation, and it's hard to get an A, well, almost impossible.","A Very dedicated teacher, knows his stuff, i.e. all the books, all the subjects concerning Civil War and Reconstruction.","makes history seem more like a story rather than facts we have to learn... good lecturer","Take good notes and you will do fine."],"courses":["HIST565","CIVILWAR212","HIST565","HIST127","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST560","HIST565","HIST128","HIST128","HIST1100","HIST22","HST022","HIST022","HIST022","254","HST22","HIST100"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"HIST","catalog_nbr":398,"section":6,"class_nbr":10213,"title":"UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Hamilton Hall","room":"0570","days":"Tu","time":"14","instructor":"LELOUDIS,JAMES L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CI"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":12,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=326604","fname":"James","lname":"Leloudis","quality":"3.7","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Respected (1)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["RESPECTED"],"comments":["Dr. Leloudis is a great guy with a deep passion and knowledge for NC history.

I worked hard and read maybe 85% of the readings.","I didn't enjoy this class whatsoever. The lectures are so boring and Professor Jackson expects you to memorize everything shes ever said. The tests are all essays, she grades harshly, and they are never clear. I was left confused after every lecture. Along with this, she is not helpful if you talk to her outside of class either. Would not recommend","Jerma Jackson is the worst professor I have ever had at UNC. She gives you an insane amount of info in lecture, and expects you to remember it all in insane detail. There are also very lengthy readings before every class, which you're practically expected to memorize. The test are 100% essay based. If you care about your GPA, don't take her class.","Her powerpoint are not helpful at all and the textbook is just a bunch of different readings. She basically just talks the entire class and so its really hard to write down all of the important things because if you miss them when she's talking there's nowhere else to find them. Super boring wouldn't take her as a prof.","Really enjoyed lecture. Super engaging, really kind. Great history class.","If you value your time and want to even marginally enjoy your semester do not take anything with her.Her lectures have little substance and she will literally spend the entire time reading powerpoints to you and \"analyzing pictures\" by making obvious statements about them.Also,she has an annoying voice and talks to people like they are children.","Professor Jackson is a great lecturer. Her class is one of my favorites just because it's interesting! Your TA determines your grade, but Jackson creates the prompts for the writing assignments that will be due every other week. Certainly not an 'easy A' class. She often requires you to stay past the scheduled class time so prepare for that.","Don't expect a good grade, but if you're one of those rare people who come to college looking to be challenged and better yourself, take her class! She has real wisdom and, like any teacher worth learning from, she makes you work for it. If you leave her class angry at anyone but yourself you're doing it wrong.","Literally the worst teacher I've ever had. Rude, mean and moody. Often demands class stay past time. Supposed to be an American History class, basically AfAm hist class without the diversity credit. Asks for \"significance\" on tests, but grades by seeking specific answers instead of seeing what you know like most history classes. Horrible experience","Dr. Jackson is great! She pushes you hard, and makes you defend your point of view, but in her class I became a much stronger writer and critical thinker. Classes like this with professors like her are what college is all about!","Horrible professor. FYS's are supposed to be easier than other classes. Instead, she assigned 2 2-page papers a week, acted like this was the only class her students were taking, and took pride in giving out only 1 A for each assignment. She needs to get over herself.","She is an interesting professor, and she really knows her stuff.  What is really frustrating, however, is the way she grades.  I took her first year seminar expecting it to be an easy A, as all FYSs really should be, but instead I'll be lucky to make a B.","Jackson is an amazing professor. She really knows the information and is passionate about it, so she makes the experience interesting. It's almost fun just watching her teach. The weekly response papers can be difficult, but the grading on those depends on your TA. Jackson herself is great, though. I would definitely recommend her.","She's amazing! Her comments on papers really helped me to improve my writing and find greater meaning in the text.","Thought Jackson was great. She has a fresh perspective on am. history and exposes viewpoints that most teachers wouldnt dare illuminate.

She's super nice and easy-going though, so overall she was good!","Dr. Lindsay is a genuinely nice person, knowledgable, enthusiastic, and helpful.

She is so enthusiastic about teaching, so passionate about her material, so caring about her students!  She is dazzling in her lecture and her eyes really do sparkle!  I feel really fortunate to have had her.  I would love to repeat it!","Pleasing, smart, and pleasant, but at the end of the day, not that much soul or fire.  No way not to like her lectures, but unlike some of the students who have ratd her I found myself wondering whether this is just a job for her.
