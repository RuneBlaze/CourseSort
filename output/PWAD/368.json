Knows history like the back of his hand. If you go to class the exams are easy!","Pretty terrible teacher in my opinion. He's kind of mean and he admits it, which is just absurd. I also had to deal with some really terrible TA that just made the class worse.","Very interesting teaching style.  No powerpoints, just straight from the hip and well knowledged.  Definitely will have to do all the readings as the exams will be based on them.","Lectures were very interesting, one of the best lecturers at UNC.  Tests are specific and difficult if your not prepared with the small details, but this is the case with many history classes.  Would recommend, but make sure you remember the terms he gives because your grade depends on it.","Professor Glatthaar's class is great. He teaches history from a fun facts and stories perspective so you don't have to be a history major to enjoy/do well in the class. Readings are interesting and reasonable, lectures are fascinating. He can be mildly offensive sometimes but I found it funny. Great class!","He is awesome! Very humorous and keeps class interesting.","Great Professor! He is absolutely one of the best professors at UNC and one of the best professors in the United States. One of the graduate students told me that he is known nationally. Even if you don't like history, take him! His average is a B, which at UNC means EXCELENTE!!! Also, he is very pleasant around students. Take Glatthaar!!!","Great professor. Going to class is a must & it really shows off if you do.  He's actually very friendly and will remember your face from class even if you don't speak. However, with 4 TAs doing all the grading, grading wasn't standardized. Also, Glatthaar sometimes shows his hotheadedness when things don't go his way. Overall an interesting class.","I liked Glatthaar.  Sometimes he was a little too opinionated...remember, it's history.  He was very knowledgeable about his subject and really seemed to enjoy teaching it to us.  Kind of liked how there was no textbooks, we just read 5 small novels.  However, he didn't allow laptops.  If you're good about takin notes & following a lecture take him","Great professor. He holds class the entire time, but his lectures are well worth it. A bit intimidating at first, but kind and helpful. No textbook, but the assigned novels are interesting and complement the material well. I highly recommend, even for anyone who doesn't like history. One of my favorite classes so far at Carolina.","LOVED Joe Glatthaar. I took him when he was at University of Houston.  He's a fascinating guy with tremendous life experience and wisdom!  Take him and you will learn to love history if you don't already!","He is wonderful! Very interested in the subject matter, and excited to be teaching it.  I thought history was ok, but he made it live! I would recommend him to anyone! No textbook, but novels to read that are interesting.  Also, he's funny and very lively.","I enjoyed his class so much in 128 that I wanted to take another history class of his (368)since I needed one. His lectures are never boring and he tells funny anecdotes that make class interesting. No textbook use, but lots of novels that you definitely should read. Tests are not terrible, about half fill-in and half essay. REALLY knows his stuff.","I have never enjoyed history until I took his class. He's a great teacher, and I learned a lot, but I only got a C+...","Funny guy who makes the huge US history survey course interesting. Sadly TAs will do all the grading and it can be really hit or miss. Then again thats the same for just about every big class like this one. Glatthaar is a pretty good teacher though, if you can deal with an occasionally irreverent style I'd recommend the class.","I really liked him as a teacher and would recommend his class but the grading is really dependent upon your TA. I found his lectures interesting and if you take notes, the tests are easy. The outside novels aren't that bad to read.","Amazinggggggg teacher. I adore the class. Tests are easy, just review the lecture notes (go to lecture) and my TA was extremely kind and fair in grading. He goes a bit fast in lecture but lets out early. Be prepared to read historical novels, but rarely any use of the history textbook! I recommend it.","Lectures rambled.  Grading was arbitrary.  Professor was rude to students, and he said anyone who disagreed with his opinions was an idiot (I kid you not).  He used a ton of foul language (and I mean he would make a sailor blush). People with positive reviews must be overlooking these faults.  Hard to make a good grade.","I found this teacher to be incredibly annoying.  Being a bit of a history buff myself, I found that he often got his facts/stories either mixed-up or entirely wrong.  With other reasons, this is why sometimes I couldn't stand going to class. It was like swallowing a cockroach for 75 minutes.  I realize my opinion isn't the popular one, but oh well.","Class was always interesting and he often told humorous history anecdotes.  Tests were only on information given in lectures, text book reading isn't required.  We had to read three books and write short essays on them during the tests.  The tests also included a long essay on specified topics in lectures and ten multiple choice questions."],"courses":["HIST128","HIST127","HIST369","HIST368","HIST368","HIST127","HIST128","HIST128","HIST127","HIST368","HIST101","HIST127","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST368","HIST127","HIST127"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PWAD","catalog_nbr":368,"section":6,"class_nbr":12736,"title":"WAR/AM SOC TO 1903","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Fetzer Hall","room":"0106","days":"TuTh","time":"11","instructor":"GLATTHAAR,JOSEPH T","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["HS"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=607856","fname":"Joseph","lname":"Glatthaar","quality":"4.2","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["Great teacher!
