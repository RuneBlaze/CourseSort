But seriously, he cares about his students like none other. If you ever need help, have additional questions, etc. he will go out of his way to help you. Don't get me wrong, ANTH 491 is super dull, but regardless I enjoyed Professor Nonini and would recommend the class overall.","I loved the class but was kind of so-so about the Prof. Nonini. The readings were great and I could tell that the professor put a lot of time and effort into the topics he taught but I felt as if the lectures were not the greatest uses of time. It seemed like he would spend a lot of time covering the small details that we had already read about.","If you can take 297, the core class for Anthropology majors, from anyone other than Dr. Nonini, do it.  His class centers around making you prove to him that you've done the readings, largely by writing up detailed outlines of them, middle-school style.  Lectures are stream-of-consciousness rambles with little opportunity for discussion."],"courses":["ANTH491","ANTH466","ANTH297"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR"]}}]
