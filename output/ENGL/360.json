She found a way to make the entire Asian American Lit class about the Japanese American Incarceration, which turned out to be really interesting. There is a lot of reading for this class, and if you do not read, you will likely not do well on the essays/final exam. Some people had problems with this class, but I loved it!","Dr. Kim was an interesting professor to have. The entire course surrounded the Japanese American incarceration, which frankly I'm shocked could be an entire class. While I did enjoy some aspects of the class, I found some parts to be a bit mundane, in addition to Dr. Kim's voice sometimes drawing my attention away. Nonetheless, she's very nice!"],"courses":["ENGL360","ENGL360"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
