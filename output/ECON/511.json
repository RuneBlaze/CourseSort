Advanced micro is a very hard math-intensive course, but his tests are very fair and he wants to see his students do well.  As long as you do the practice exams that he posts on sakai, you should be just fine!","A decent professor. Unfortunately his teaching isn't particularly clear. If you can learn the material on your own via the textbook you may be fine. If not you will not do well. Smart, Brazilian, and funny just not the best professor possible","Brazilian. Very Brazilian. Knows his stuff though. Class was pretty easy if you take the time to study on your own and understand the concepts. Sergio is always available to help too.","a very smart professor!","HORRIBLE prof. Can't teach and doesn't care whether you learn. Told us that he didn't care how we evaluated his class because he had tenure. Miserable experience in the course.","worst professor i've had, ever, doesnt look interested at all in class, his accent gets in the way of what he's saying, his classes are just useless, you would be a lot better off by just reading the book and not going to his lectures, he actually said he didnt care about prof evaluations because he has a tenure.","Great lecturer.  I just wish he would bring more of his (Tier 1) research to the classroom.  I suspect he was unimpressed with the quality of our class... Looking forward to Game Theory with him next spring.","The worst professor I have ever had, hands down.  Never prepared for lectures, which are a waste of time as he bumbles through material with his back to the class.  Takes 2 weeks to return exams and hw.  Exams are not necessarily on game theory (i.e. macro).  Unbelievable that the department lets him teach, let alone gave him tenure.","Great professor. Knows his material well. Makes occasional mistakes in class, but will go out of his way to explain subject matter.  Also gives out candy and money in class and makes difficult material easy to understand."],"courses":["ECON510","ECON511","ECON511","ECON511","ECON401","ECON410","ECON711","ECON711","ECON511"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
