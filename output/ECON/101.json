She is also always available for office hours and is patience and sincere.","Not a fan of the flipped classroom style. Balaban expects you to come to class understanding what she's gonna talk about. It's very intimidating to ask a \"dumb/basic question\" in front of 200+ people. Some of the TAs are outright idiots. Balaban is smart af, but this is a hard class unless you've had econ before. Go to class is a must, and read!","Balaban uses Poll Everywhere to encourage attendance. While it is not a huge part of your grade going to class is extremely helpful because she works out problems just like the ones that will be on the test. It shows what you really need to know, and if you don't pay attention you'll end up working harder than you had to learning things not tested.","Rita really knows her stuff, and she cares about her students. In this class, you get out what you put in. The poll questions in class are a bit tricky but they really make you delve deep in the material. i feel like I have learned so much from this class.","The pros to taking ECON 101H with Balaban are the small classroom size, a clear set of course expectations, and lots of  practice with problem-solving. However, I didn't really find the flipped-learning style to be that effective... it forced students to spend lots of time digging into the concepts, that could have been saved with in-class lecture.","Great class & professor! I liked the reversed classroom style because it forced me to actually pay attention & learn the material. That way when I went to class, I was engaged by answering the polls. The tests are tricky but doing the practice multiple choice questions will help. Also, recitation helped by reinforcing more difficult concepts.","Rita is now doing a flipped classroom so class is good for practice problems, but its a huge class and not attending won't kill your grade. Most of your grade comes from the two midterms and final, which you definitely need to study a decent amount for. If you watch the videos before class and keep up with the work getting a good grade is managable","Amazing professor! If you do all the assignments and study, there is not reason why you shouldnt do well. Tests arent unreasonable. I didnt do too well because I didnt study, but I really enjoyed her class. She is BRILLIANT! You will have to work hard -- but if you work hard, youll understand the material very well. Her econ videos are great!!","Balaban is great. Had her last semester and I enjoyed the class. I know that ECON101 is the dreaded pre-req for many majors, but Balaban makes it bearable for those who hate it. The class is a flipped class. I am personally not a fan of flipped classrooms, but Balaban does a good job with it.","Class and some concepts can be difficult at times, but Balaban is very thorough and certainly knows her stuff. The math part of this course is very basic, but is can be difficult understanding how certain concepts connect and then applying them new ones. There is a lot of information to learn in this course (can be overbearing), but overall its :)","Professor Balaban was a phenomenal teacher. The flipped classroom is very effective with her class, because it allows you to go more in depth and work through examples in class. If you keep up with the work, it is not hard (but I wouldn't say it's an easy A).","Rita is great and cares about her students! You really have to be on top of your work. Make sure you either read or watch the videos (both is not necessary) and don't get behind. If you study for the tests you'll do fine (all multiple choice). Biggest help in preparing for the tests are the attached multiple choice that correspond to the chapter.","A very knowledgeable teacher, Balaban can teach economics. It gets boring to come to class and hear her talk about what you already learned online, though. Tests are very tricky, so you have to study hard to do well. Never get behind on material.","I love Rita! The flipped class might be difficult to adjust to at first, but you'll soon realize how much it helps you deeply understand and critically think about the material. I came into this class knowing nothing about economics, and now I love it. She's tricky on tests, but you can ace 'em if you can conquer the heavy workload and study hard.","Balaban is a solid econ prof. Really learned a lot from her. Tests are harder than the practice she gives you (but not crazy). Expect some test questions that approach topics in ways not explicitly worked out in class (but are totally doable if you understand underlying concepts). I took Honors though so my tests may have been harder than normal.","Good instructor, tough to pull out an A. She goes over material well","In ECON 101 she uses a flipped classroom. I did well with this because I have a hard time being self-disciplined enough to do practice problems on my own. She keeps you fairly busy for the semester but I think it's very helpful.","Flipped classroom style. Works problems in class in addition to lecturing, videos outside of class.","Really knows what she is talking about and a good amount of resources but makes things (tests) way tougher and more advanced than necessary.","Prof. Balaban is extremely hard to understand. She uses the flipped-classroom method and takes full advantage of that. You are expected to have mastered the material before coming to class, and she is not at all accessible to answer questions during lecture.

Our tests were free response and he gave a lot of partial credit. Only homework was studying for the exams and short presentation you would give during recitation every 2 weeks. Class not that bad.","Avoid taking his class. He wants to clarify every point but his lecture is too lengthy and complicated. Learn from textbook will be more helpful. His grading is too strange and tests are tough.","Turchi is a nice guy and he loves economics, but sometimes he can overcomplicate things and make them confusing. Reading the book is not necessary, but it helped myself further understand the material. Regardless, ECON 101 is just a hard class regardless.","His lectures are incoherent. He gets off on wild tangents and I, as someone who doesn't immediately understand math and statistical analysis right away, am left completely clueless. And then there's his beautiful line, \"If you want, you can come up here and I'll explain it better with calculus.\" something that would help me like a punch to the face","Terrible class. Avoid Turchi as a professor at all costs.","there are three components of the class - mystatlab, stata, and lectures. and none of the components work together to facilitate learning. the exams are lengthy, complexified expansions of turchi's confusing and unorganized lectures.","His lectures are not useful; he just rambles on about data that you don't need to know. You'll have to teach yourself through the textbook. There is a lot of homework (stata and statlab take hours to do).","His lectures for econ 400 are completely unhelpful. I ended up just teaching myself from the textbooks.","Turchi is a nice man and he tries to be helpful, but in doing so he often over-complicates things that should be simple. His exams are very difficult (he aims for class average to be around a 70), but his homework is relatively easy.","One of the most ambiguous professors I've ever had. Often crams many different ideas onto one single graph, and boy does he love graphs. Graphs take up more space in your notes than words. The practices tests aren't anything like the actual tests although he claims they will be. If you don't read the text you will be lost. Exams are short but hard.","Rough teacher, very dry and slow. Doesn't inspire nor motivate. He's knowledgeable, might make for a good faculty, but an awful teacher. Ended up just skipping his class (econ 101) and read straight from the textbook. Take Balaban or Conway if you can.","He likes to ramble on and on in lecture with useless information that you'll probably never see on the test. You have to read your textbook and attend every recitation in order to make a decent grade. Gives out handouts and there are ALWAYS test questions with that info. Hardest tests ever. You definitely have to work for a good grade","I made an A, but that was rare. Tests are unbearable and lectures do not help at all. Your only chance is to go over practice Exams and pray","I'm not normally one to be tough on my college professors, but Turchi is the worst I've had in my 3 years as a college student. He spews out arcane economic vocabulary as he draws random, illegible graphs that confuse the whole class. Class average on the test is consistently below a 70, showing how little the class actually learns from him","Maybe Turchi is tough for Econ 101--I don't know--but he is easy for Econ 400. I literally have 100 in the class without putting that much time in. The Stata assignments and homework can take a long time, but beside that, the class is great.","This is a hard teacher, but he's probably one of the smartest professors I've ever had (if you care about that - take him). He doesn't use PPT or anything just writes stuff down and talks.  Bit hard to stay awake and focused - even though I'm an Econ major and am passionate about the subject.

She is also always available for office hours and is patience and sincere.","Not a fan of the flipped classroom style. Balaban expects you to come to class understanding what she's gonna talk about. It's very intimidating to ask a \"dumb/basic question\" in front of 200+ people. Some of the TAs are outright idiots. Balaban is smart af, but this is a hard class unless you've had econ before. Go to class is a must, and read!","Balaban uses Poll Everywhere to encourage attendance. While it is not a huge part of your grade going to class is extremely helpful because she works out problems just like the ones that will be on the test. It shows what you really need to know, and if you don't pay attention you'll end up working harder than you had to learning things not tested.","Rita really knows her stuff, and she cares about her students. In this class, you get out what you put in. The poll questions in class are a bit tricky but they really make you delve deep in the material. i feel like I have learned so much from this class.","The pros to taking ECON 101H with Balaban are the small classroom size, a clear set of course expectations, and lots of  practice with problem-solving. However, I didn't really find the flipped-learning style to be that effective... it forced students to spend lots of time digging into the concepts, that could have been saved with in-class lecture.","Great class & professor! I liked the reversed classroom style because it forced me to actually pay attention & learn the material. That way when I went to class, I was engaged by answering the polls. The tests are tricky but doing the practice multiple choice questions will help. Also, recitation helped by reinforcing more difficult concepts.","Rita is now doing a flipped classroom so class is good for practice problems, but its a huge class and not attending won't kill your grade. Most of your grade comes from the two midterms and final, which you definitely need to study a decent amount for. If you watch the videos before class and keep up with the work getting a good grade is managable","Amazing professor! If you do all the assignments and study, there is not reason why you shouldnt do well. Tests arent unreasonable. I didnt do too well because I didnt study, but I really enjoyed her class. She is BRILLIANT! You will have to work hard -- but if you work hard, youll understand the material very well. Her econ videos are great!!","Balaban is great. Had her last semester and I enjoyed the class. I know that ECON101 is the dreaded pre-req for many majors, but Balaban makes it bearable for those who hate it. The class is a flipped class. I am personally not a fan of flipped classrooms, but Balaban does a good job with it.","Class and some concepts can be difficult at times, but Balaban is very thorough and certainly knows her stuff. The math part of this course is very basic, but is can be difficult understanding how certain concepts connect and then applying them new ones. There is a lot of information to learn in this course (can be overbearing), but overall its :)","Professor Balaban was a phenomenal teacher. The flipped classroom is very effective with her class, because it allows you to go more in depth and work through examples in class. If you keep up with the work, it is not hard (but I wouldn't say it's an easy A).","Rita is great and cares about her students! You really have to be on top of your work. Make sure you either read or watch the videos (both is not necessary) and don't get behind. If you study for the tests you'll do fine (all multiple choice). Biggest help in preparing for the tests are the attached multiple choice that correspond to the chapter.","A very knowledgeable teacher, Balaban can teach economics. It gets boring to come to class and hear her talk about what you already learned online, though. Tests are very tricky, so you have to study hard to do well. Never get behind on material.","I love Rita! The flipped class might be difficult to adjust to at first, but you'll soon realize how much it helps you deeply understand and critically think about the material. I came into this class knowing nothing about economics, and now I love it. She's tricky on tests, but you can ace 'em if you can conquer the heavy workload and study hard.","Balaban is a solid econ prof. Really learned a lot from her. Tests are harder than the practice she gives you (but not crazy). Expect some test questions that approach topics in ways not explicitly worked out in class (but are totally doable if you understand underlying concepts). I took Honors though so my tests may have been harder than normal.","Good instructor, tough to pull out an A. She goes over material well","In ECON 101 she uses a flipped classroom. I did well with this because I have a hard time being self-disciplined enough to do practice problems on my own. She keeps you fairly busy for the semester but I think it's very helpful.","Flipped classroom style. Works problems in class in addition to lecturing, videos outside of class.","Really knows what she is talking about and a good amount of resources but makes things (tests) way tougher and more advanced than necessary.","Prof. Balaban is extremely hard to understand. She uses the flipped-classroom method and takes full advantage of that. You are expected to have mastered the material before coming to class, and she is not at all accessible to answer questions during lecture.
