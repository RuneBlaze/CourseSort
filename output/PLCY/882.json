I would really recommend going to office hours and not waiting until the end of the semester to do so. He also has a sense of humor, although it may fly over your head if you're uptight","Dr. Moulton is very knowledgeable about the quantitative side of public policy. However, I would not take him due to his inability to bring clarity to content. Other tags I would ad: loves to play games (w/ your grade and tests), boring and will put you to sleep.  Don't roll the dice on this man. Take someone else. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."],"courses":["PLCY460","PLCY460"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR"]}}]
