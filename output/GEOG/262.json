He's the man. I would take him again, but he's semi-retired. He enjoys the material and you can tell. Sometimes says things that are semi-questionable, but ABSOLUTELY loved him! Would recommend again. Studied for tests reading the textbook only the night before, but I still showed up to class everyday though. Would take again 100%","This is my easiest class of my first semester it saved me.  All the info you need for the tests are straight from his lectures and with a little studying its easy to get an A.  He loves his job and likes to make jokes during class.","VERY easy class. Everything on the tests is in his lectures, so just take notes and pay attention, maybe skim the textbook for extra studying before the test. Much of what he talks about comes from basic history and current events of each region or physical geography (like mountains and rainfall). Papers are also easy to write and graded generously","Definitely go to class.  His tests are almost completely things he's talked about solely in class lectures.  The book is helpful for more information, but not really information on the tests.  Off-topic sometimes and a definite rambler. Must like the class!","He makes you think the test wont be hard, but definitely write down everything he says and make sure you at least skim read before the test. Relatively easy though.","The attendence is not mandatory but I felt that if i did not go then i would miss a whole lot of information that would definitely be on the test. He loved when people asked questions and i didn't think i would be that interested in geography but i loved the class. basically u just have to take good notes and study them.","ok so i thought this class was going to be alot easier than it was. Florin is very boring and most of the time it does not seem that he is on topic. You have to like geog. to understand his class. Test aren't hard but you have to rem. alot.","This is a class everyone must take.  It is very informative and interesting, plus Florin is a great professor.  He sucks with technology, all the ladies think its &quot;cute.&quot;","Florin was my favorite teacher of the semester.  His class was very interesting and made me want to take more geography classes.  He was very helpful outside of class too.  I would recomend his class to anyone!","Florin is a great guy, but I found his lectures to be terribly boring.  Perhaps if the subject matter had been more interesting, I would have been more engaged.  He is a little out of touch with modern technology, and a bit scatterbrained.  If you have the patience to put up with a few weaknesses, his class might be ok.  Not one of my favorites.","DO NOT SKIP HIS CLASSES!  That was my only problem with this class.  Florin is a great prof and knows the material well.","Great teacher.","best class i've taken","Best professor I had out of the semester.  He's entertaining and funny in a grandfatherly way, and I always found him engaging even during his tangents.  I would unconditionally recommend Florin.","I agree with the reviewer above.  This guy is almost impossible to follow in class.  Good thing he doesn't give hard tests or everyone would fail.  He also never responded to my emails so he wasn't personally helpful to me when I needed it.","No Comments","He's the weirdest professor I've had. He spends half of the class talking about irrelevant topics--while the rest of the class is devoted to 30 minutes of talking about &quot;x,&quot; digressing into tangents probably every 2 minutes. Really easy--really","Very sweet guy, interesting class, not very hard","Really cares about students.","No Comments"],"courses":["GEOG120","GEOG262","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG20","GEOG100","GEO100"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
