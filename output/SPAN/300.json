At first she seems a bit all over the place, but if you take notes and pay attention you'll be fine. I only used the textbook for the final. If she doesn't understand your question, just keep clarifying. She really knows what she's talking about!","If you're a Spanish major this is required so you have no choice but to take this course. If possible, wait for another professor to be assigned to teach. She is so disorganized and takes SO long to grade things/give them back. Going into the final you will have no idea what you have in the class. She is a lazy grader. However she is smart.","She's very kind& cute but I find myself leaving lecture confused about the actual application. I agree, she is a fair grader! The homework is extremely do-able. Don't worry about that aspect at all. Not a bad class all things considered, but I struggle with grammar, so I am reminded of all of the things I don't know that I thought I already knew...","She is all over the place with her lectures.  She doesn't believe in lesson plans.  In this class she wants you to know all the information from the book and all we did waqs presentations. She taught maybe 4 of the 15 weeks we had class.  She wastes a lot of class time.  She is, however, a fair grader."],"courses":["SPAN376","SPAN376","SPAN300","SPAN377"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":300,"section":2,"class_nbr":13212,"title":"SPAN COMPOS/GRAMMAR","component":"REV","units":0,"bldg":"Hamilton Hall","room":"0425","days":"MWF","time":"09","instructor":"Casey,Elena Nicole","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["FI"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2087409","fname":"Elena","lname":"Casey","quality":"5.0","easiness":"2.5","help":"2.5","clarity":"2.5","topTag":"Caring (2)","grade":"2.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["CARING","RESPECTED"],"comments":["I loved Prof Elena; she was my favorite professor.

She is respectful, kind, knowledgeable, clear, and helpful. She does an excellent job at answering any question. First Spanish class I had taken in 2 years, and her helpfulness saved me.

She did a good job of making a very boring subject (grammar) pretty interesting. She's prone to go on tangents in class, so be prepared. The class was pretty tough at first, but don't be discouraged because it gets easier. Go to her office hours, she really is there for her students!","Dr. Lee is SO smart and funny.   I was very intimidated after the first day, looking at the syllabus was very overwhelming. We had a paper due on like the third day of class! BUT MAN!!! Once you get used to the work load (which eases up as the semester continues) the class is GREAT!!!! I learned so much and I will take more of her classes.","You can get points taken off for things don't involve your understanding of the material.  Also make sure the Spanish is correct in your papers, the content doesn't matter so much.","Dr. Lee is a cool professor, but can be condescending to all American students. She's traveled a lot and has a lot to share, but puts shame on those who have never been outside the United States and makes you feel ignorant. She's also a pretty funny person too, cracking a joke once in a while. The class was harder than necessary, but still doable..","She is nice and always has interesting stories to tell. But she gives lots of small assignments and pop quizzes that can kill your grade because they are so difficult. She is a good teacher- but spanish 204 is hard and is a huge jump from 203. If coming from high school consider 203 for an easy A.","Quizzes are almost impossible. The information isn't always relevant to what is studied in class. However, she makes the class very enjoyable. She makes you speak in Spanish which is super annoying but helpful! My conversation skills have improved immensely. Just be prepared for hard quizzes and tests. The grammar handbook has examples that help.","Span 102 online- The book is not very helpful IMO because i doesn't give enough examples. That makes actually doing the classwork and homework necessary if you really want to understand the material. Ambiciones Siniestras is ok, if your really good at understanding the long paragraphs and fast talking in videos. Overall, class participation is key.","The worksheets and the PowerPoints were really helpful.  The book was not helpful to me at all.  Ambiciones siniestras went way too quickly for someone who is learning elementary Spanish.  The tests were pretty straightforward, however, if you spelled something wrong or missed an accent mark, you missed the whole question.  Quizzes were helpful.","The videos in the book she uses are sometimes hard to understand and she texts and quizes you on it. There is very little accountability for completing the worksheets which makes you less likely to work on it all week. One class a week is not much either so its easy to put it off. Power points and class are very helpful and cover everything.","The online testsquizzes do not give partial credit and count the answer completely wrong for the smallest mistakes. I liked the worksheets because they helped me follow along with class because I do not work well under pressure of being randomly called on. The professor was very helpful and clear. Overall, great class.","The stuff that helped me within this class was the pronunciation quizzes and powerpoints. The pronunciation quizzes allowed me to see how well I spoke Spanish, which helped a lot. I was thankful the powerpoints were available because sometimes the textbook made the grammar hard to understand but the powerpoints broke it down better.","SPAN 102-Online The powerpoint and worksheets helped me because I could follow along with the class without being put completely on the spot. The videos from the textbook did not help because they went too fast and I could not really understand the story. Unfortunately  testsquizzes do not give partial credit. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.","I had a bad experience with SPAN 204 and SPAN 255 professors and almost began to hate Spanish. However, after having Professor Lee, I've remembered why I love Spanish so much. She's amazing, funny, has a lot of insight on the world through her travels, and a great lecturer. Class is generally difficult, I guess, but she helps you along the way. 55","She's an awesome professor! She has traveled everywhere and can really give you a lot of insight about various countries and interesting facts. If you come to class & try to participate as much as possible, you'll do well. You can tell she loves what she does. The class was at 9am and she was always enthusiastic. She's really sweet. TAKE HER CLASS!","The cultural information provided both before and after the viewing of each movie is very helpful to understanding some of the sayings and humor that appears. It also allows for the student to relate better to the Spanish culture.","Sra. Lee is one of the best professors at UNC. If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it! She genuinely loves her job and that is demonstrated through her teaching. This class does require a significant amount of time outside of class watching movies and completing book exercises.","Professor Lee is great! She is very knowledgable, and always keeps class interesting.","Professor Lee is one of the best Spanish professors I've had at UNC. The content of the class is already really interesting but her comments make it even more enjoyable.","The professor keeps this class interesting with additional information about real life events relating to the movies. Her office hours are flexible and she is available if you need help.","I like this class a lot. Not only is it an advanced level course allowing for fluent conversation in SPanish, the information and history we are learning by watching the films is very interesting. If you like to speak spanish, learn spanish history, and practice a lot-you will do fine and enjoy the class!"],"courses":["SPAN300","SPAN3OO","SPAN333","SPAN333","SPAN204","SPAN300","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN102FALL14","SPAN102","SPAN300","SPAN255","SPAN333002","SPAN333002","SPAN333002","SPAN333","SPAN33302","333001"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":300,"section":6,"class_nbr":3166,"title":"SPAN COMPOS/GRAMMAR","component":"REV","units":0,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0402","days":"MWF","time":"12","instructor":"HUER,KYUNG","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["FI"],"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":20,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":1,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1193948","fname":"Kyung","lname":"Huer","quality":"3.5","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"Participation matters (4)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["PARTICIPATION MATTERS","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","LOTS OF HOMEWORK"],"comments":["KH was a great professor. He is very funny and always encouraged us to participate in class. He does get visibly upset when people don't participate in class, but he notices improvements, and they will show up in your grade. Gives a lot of very easy quizzes so those can be helpful. Always willing to offer help in office hours.","I had Huer for 105, which covers Span 101 & 102 in one semester. Therefore, we covered a LOT of material. However, he made it very enjoyable! Huer really wanted us all to participate and do well in his class. Also, he can be really funny and is sure to make you laugh! His English is a little hard to understand, but his Spanish is on point.","His class is gonna be fast paced as he is remarkably fluid in Spanish, but it'll be relatively OK if you actually participate. He takes that part really seriously, and as a result his Spanish classes are usually more social than others.","In-class participation is a must. Prof. Huer is enthusiastic and funny in class! But he's not always clear and many times doesn't understand your questions (especially in English). Not a bad professor, but not the best either.","He is an awesome teacher, really funny in class and makes Spanish-speaking environment not terrifying. Can be a little difficult to understand in English, but his tests are easy.","This guy is hilarious, I would be giggling the whole class. He is super enthusiastic in his little asian man way. Love this teacher and he made my first spanish class soooo good!","Huer's class is easy you just read the book, do online homework every night, and take oral exams. He's really big on participation. There is no final exam- just a group video project","Professor Huer is extremely helpful, funny, understanding and nice.  His spanish is slightly mumbled at times & though and his English is not necessarily the best, he is always eager to help students!  There is daily textbook homework that's completed online, which is not complicated. The exams are oral.  The final includes making a 15 min. video","Very nice and helpful, but can be hard to understand at times. The class size is fairly small, and he is pretty good at teaching one on one.","I love his class.
