Be prepared to participate in class if you want to pass-this is not a class you can skip. As long as you read the material, pay attention in class, and speak up your hard work will be rewarded.","Her class was very, very discussion heavy. She will ask you to participate if you do not speak up in class, which can be nerve-wracking. I found this class interesting but could not find anything to contribute to the lectures, which impacted my grade. She's happy to meet & discuss your paper with you,  & enjoys interacting with her students.","Rosenthal is a great professor! She makes it clear what she wants and is very willing to help you. There's a lot of reading but it's relatively interesting and as long as you keep up with it you'll be fine. I hate writing but because I participated in class and got help from her for our 2 essays I still managed to do well.","Really liked her. Lots of reading, but she chooses great books and there are only two papers. Strongly emphasizes small group discussion and participation is important. Not my favorite of all time but I would take a class with her again.","Really great and enthusiastic professor. Only downfall is that it is impossible to get an A, unless you are a regular at her office hours. I wasn't. The novels are really interesting and she gives a few movie days which is awesome. Only two papers but she's harsh on grammar but a fair grader. Overall one of my favorite classes at UNC.","Sweet and funny professor! She's really nice and definitely helpful. Very discussion based classes, but even I as a very shy person enjoyed participating. This was my favorite class this semester and I want to take another with her!","I had her for Gothic Literature which I took to fulfill a requirement and it turned out to be a great class! Lots of reading(it's an English class, what do you expect) but some of it I really enjoyed. Significant participation grade but she was good at fostering discussion. Two papers, a presentation, and no tests--pretty easy. Good teacher.","She is very approachable and understanding.  If you are having trouble getting something done she will work with you.","Class is very discussion based. I'm shy in class and this was great for me - it helped me open up. She's really nice, and there's not much work besides keeping up with the readings. Two papers, essay based midterm and final. A lot of reading, but she gives you a reasonable amount of time to do it."],"courses":["ENGL240","ENGL263","ENGL263","ENGL145","145","ENGL145","ENGL263","ENGL395","ENGL263","ENGL331"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
