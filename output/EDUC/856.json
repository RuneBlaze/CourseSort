She really cares about getting to know her students, and is so friendly. The class is interesting and mostly based on open discussion. If you want to express your perspective on K-12 education and have it broadened, take this class. You'll probably make lasting friends there too."],"courses":["EDUC065"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
