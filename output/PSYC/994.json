Awful.","Dr. Lowman is my favorite professor @ Carolina...he is hilarious and pretty much knows everything about any topic in the world.

It is definitely an easy A. There are 5 short papers, 3 exams, and 1 final. You can drop the lowest grade for the papers and exams. Lectures are long but interesting. He likes to test people on the videos/examples/demonstrations, so take notes during those. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK. It is a huge waste of your money.","I didn't do quite as well as I thought I would in the class. The Psych 101 exams are all multiple choice, but he can be very detailed in lectures and on the exam, so the class is mostly a lot of fine memorization. Be prepared to understand minute differences in the material. I blame a tough TA for some bad essay grades. Overall a great class though","Dr. Penn has been my favorite professor at UNC so far. He is so passionate about what he teaches, and genuinely cares about each student's well being in the class. He notices when people are bored, and tries to entertain us with videos to make the material easier to learn. His tests aren't hard if you go to class. Loved this class.","Penn's class has been my favorite so far! He is funny and passionate. This class covers a lot of material so reading and taking notes in class is mandatory. He will have random questions on the test that deal with videos he shows in class and they usually have nothing to do with the material. Essays are graded by TAs, and some grade harder.","Great teacher! He was definitely the best professor I had this semester. It's fairly easy to do well as long as you go to class every day and make sure to study before the tests. He puts questions that come directly from what is covered in class.","Professor Penn's class is super easy. His lectures include every possible test question - so just show up and pay attention. You don't even have to read the textbook. Not to mention he drops the lowest test score. Plus, you have short essays that are super easy and interesting which he also drops the lowest score for. Lectures are interesting!","Dr. Penn and his class has been the HIGHLIGHT of my first semester at UNC. I did open the textbook once, attended every single lesson and still got an A in his class. His lectures are entertaining and covers all the information needed to ace the exams. Disappointed that he does not teach other courses for undergraduate students.","I loved Penn! He's a super fun guy and very quirky. You need to go to class, though, because he shows a lot of videos that he includes questions about on his exams and you don't have access to the videos unless you watch them in class!","Penn is the nicest man alive. His character is so warm and friendly. Penn's lectures are really interesting and he uses informative and funny videos throughout the lecture. He really tries to know your name when you participate. No homework! Grade: 3 exams and 5 essays lowest dropped for both. Go to class to pass. Lecture specific exam ?'s.","Dr. Penn is the man! PSYC 101 was by far the best class that I have had at UNC thus far. He is enthusiastic and hilarious during lectures. YOU MUST GO TO CLASS TO PASS. His tests are based purely on what happens in class and not really based on the textbook. As long as you take detailed notes you should be fine.","Dr. Penn is a great professor and will always help if you come to him. Lectures are sometimes a little boring, but he's excited about the subject, which makes them bearable. I would suggest showing up to every class because the info on the PowerPoints is generally just an outline of what he covers. He tells exactly what to expect on exams.","Penn is a great teacher! He is the reason I am a Psyc major. He really rewards students that go to class (if you go to class and study a little for the test, you'll get an A) and his study guides for his tests are very clear if you have been to class.","Penn is an awesome professor. I had never taken a psych class before his, and now I am in love. The tests are super simple. It's all memorization, and straight from the notes. If you come to class, you'll get a good grade.","Wonderful teacher! Very clear on what will be on test and is always willing to help!","Dr. Penn is the one of the better professors at UNC. Extremely nice guy, and very clear in what he expects from you. His tests aren't too difficult, but you need to attend class to do well. Overall a great experience and if you pay attention you will learn a lot.","He's so interactive in class! He doesn't rush through lectures and gives time you time to write down the notes!","Super nice guy, great teacher. Psych is not that interesting but he does his best to change that. Funny videos in class. Necessary to go to class, most of tests are  based on lectures","I can't say enough good things. He genuinely cares about making the lecture interesting and adds funny bitsvideos. He makes an effort to learn each person's name, even though the class is over 200 people, making the class feel much more intimate. His tests are completely fair, though attending is worth your time for some of the questions!","Straightforward class, several opportunities for extra credit. If you go to most classes and put in some effort doing all the readings you will do fine! Very helpful if you have questions, tries to use videos and other interesting examples in class to keep you interested. Just took for GenEds but made me want to take more PSYC classes in the future","Took Dr. Penn's Psych 101 class. He specifically tell you \"this is going to be on the exam\" and even gives you a study guide before each exam.   Also, he incorporates some humor into his lectures, which is a good change from other professors. Very personable with students. He tries to memorize each student's name in a class of 250.
