Knows her stuff, and is super passionate about it. ENGL 120 has some pretty dry material, but she makes it bearable. Super understanding of how busy our schedules can be, and is always willing to meet and go above and beyond to help you.","Take a class with her! She is one of the best professors I have had at UNC, and is both a true scholar and a dedicated, kind person who cares about students.  She's willing to meet & edit your papers all of the time, and has even told us that she grades all of the papers in her lectures. Very passionate about literature and helps you dive into it.","A fantastic professor that is an expert on her subject. She will keep you engaged and passionate about her class. I strongly recommend that you fight to get into a small, honors class with her, because she will edit all papers and meet anytime.  I would recommend her to anyone, and you should take multiple classes with her because she gives recs.","Dr. Wolfe is absolutely brilliant and one of my favorite professors at UNC. I knew very little about the topic of classical poetry before taking her class and now I have several new favorite authors and topics. She is sure to keep you engaged, expose new interests, and help you dive into the ancient texts. Have fun!","Absolutely brilliant professor. So knowledgeable and always gives very interesting lectures. Class had 3 essays and an essay-based final, so very writing intensive. She is very accessible and helpful with these papers. Overall, a must have professor at least once.","Professor Wolfe is such an interesting professor. She really knows her stuff and I learned a ton from her class. Lectures are very interesting, though recitation kind of sucks. She grades papers pretty critically, but if you take time on it you can get a B easy. Final was a take home paper, which is great. Overall, great experience.","Jessica Wolfe is one of the best professors for comparative literature/english at UNC. Her teaching style is pretty unique (she speaks really fast!) but its not unfollowable. Keep up with the reading and you should be fine.","Professor Wolfe was very enthusiastic and occasionally humorous. During the last lecture, she said the material wouldn't appear on the final exam, and she joked, &quot;This is the part where half of the class is supposed to leave,&quot; but everyone stayed. The text was difficult to understand, but she clarifies the text in class. Beware: She does talk fast.","I really just can't say enough good things about Jessica Wolfe. She honestly opened my mind to an entire genre -- I used to find classic, epic literature dry and dull, and she revealed the complexity in each novel. What a great professor! So smart, approachable and cool. Can I be her when I grow up&#63;","Dr. Wolfe is by far one of the best teachers I've ever had. She is a brilliant lecturer and extremely helpful outside of class. Her grading is rough but she makes it so easy to do well by providing so much extra assistance and AMAZINGLY INSIGHTFUL lectures. She talks insanely fast and not a minute of time is wasted but it's all worthwhile. =)","Absolutely brilliant, enthusiastic about what she teaches, engaging and exciting at the same time that she blows your mind with her insights. She goes WAY out of her way to meet with you outside of class. Grades tough but fair, reading is very light (and not even necessary if you pay attention). Serious business, but so nice! A must-take teacher!","No Comments","She's a wolfe in sheep's clothing! Yeah, she looks small and meek, and young for a tenured professor, but this woman really knows her stuff, especially Shakespeare. The only complaint I have is that she doesn't lecture much but spends most of her time on class discussion. Still, one of the best English profs you can get.","She doesn't waste a second of class and flies through her lectures, and she's no pushover.  The final was difficult and she required two long papers.  But she knows her stuff."],"courses":["ENGL120","CMPL454H","CMPL454H","CMPL364H","ENGL327","CMPL120","CMPL120","ENGL120","CMPL120","CMPL120","CMPL120","ENGL830","ENGL58","ENG58"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
