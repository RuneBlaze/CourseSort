Lectures are hard because of the linear algebra proofs but prof. Rozansky tested only the basics. Enjoyed the fun pop problems he worked out with us in class. Also, homework is not graded.","Rozansky wants to be helpful, but he just doesn't know how to teach. Class time is spent strictly learning theorems and writing their proofs, but the test material is all applied to finite sets, and the two don't relate well. Had to hire a tutor to help me make the connections. 2 midterms (25% each) and 1 Final (50%). Test questions exactly like hw","Rozansky is knowledgeable about the material, but is not good at explaining it. His lectures are very confusing and you essentially have to teach yourself everything. Also extremely disorganized. He is approachable and willing to help, though.","Rozansky is a nice guy, but I seriously recommend avoiding his 547 class unless you can teach yourself everything.","His lectures are very confusing and hard to follow. He is a very friendly professor, but he can't explain concepts clearly. You have to teach yourself a lot. He is a nice person, but I would not recommend his MATH 547.","Lectures are hard to understand and class expectations and deadlines aren't clear. Can be funny and witty, but I still recommend taking this class with someone else.","Rozansky is the man. Funny and entertaining. Unfortunately, he uses a whole lot of proofs to teach his material, and it can get very confusing. Really work a lot of problems on your own. I aced the class but spent 6- 8 hours studying the night before every midterm working lots of problems. Problems on test similar to ones on homework.","I love this professor. He's a genuinely nice guy, he always will slow down if you ask him. His accent is so endearing as are his comments during class and his way of describing things. Definitely take him! and do the homework. It's not much, but it makes the tests pretty easy.","I would give different recommendations based upon the student's interest in math/physics.  Basically, if you enjoy math/physics, then do yourself a favor and take him! If not, go find teacher who will hold your throughout the semester. Rozansky leaves the fundamentals up to the student, and uses his time to thoroughly explore the material. A+ IMO.","Great teacher, I liked him a lot. The only grades are three exams (homework doesnt count), but if you do the homework and study hard, they're pretty straight forward. He makes class fun, and his accent is awesome when he's talking about vectors. He doesnt give many examples, but you can easily look in the book for that. Id definitely recommend him.","If you can teach yourself Calculus using a book and 3 barely comprehensible examples than please be my guest. If not then please run far far away.","he has an interesting accent and often goes on tangents but he is really nice. The tests are pretty much like the hw and he tends to help you out on the final grade. After having some of the other professors in the math department, I would totally recommend him.","It's not too bad - you end up teaching yourself a lot of stuff out of the book because he doesn't do many examples in class; if you don't do the homework, you're pretty much screwed, but if you do the homework and come to class you should be fine.","awesome teacher","I'm good at math, but could hardly ever follow his diff eq lectures.  This class was intellectual torture.  He will spend the whole time on extremely abstract material and never give an example.  He says that is what the textbook is for, but the book he uses sucks!!!  It is fairly easy to study the procedures and do well on tests though.","Awsome teacher, you learn with him a lot but you will be pretty happy when your grades are all As as long as you do the homework problems, which are not mandatory.","Rozansky is the man!He's pretty hillarious and loves to go on a bunch of physics tangents in class. He is pretty clear, but you have to get used to his teaching style. He'll help you if you ask, but at the same time if you ask him a dumb question..he won't feel bad about telling you that...","He is a fairly good professor. His odd accent is the hardest part to get past. His tests are just like his homework problems and quizzes.

Her tests are almost all based on questions shown in class or homework. She was always willing to take her time to explain something to any one student even if it took the whole class block. Overall, caring and rather straightforward tests. Webassigns took a fair amount of time though.","McLaughlin takes her time in lectures and provides plenty of examples to make sure you understand the material. The examples are much harder than the tests, so if you can do those then the tests won't be bad. There is homework twice a week, but aside from that its not a terribly demanding class. I feel like a learned a lot from McLaughlin.","She keeps it real and tries to put you in the best position to get good scores in the exam. She could be better with explaining sometimes. Take good notes in class because the problems she works on the board are likely to show up in one of the three midterms. Shes say it as it is and will usually give obvious hints for pop quizes.","Professor McLaughlin was oddly lax every time I reached out for help after receiving a not-so-great grade and just told me not to worry about it which was pretty frustrating. Unless you REALLY go out of your way to make yourself known to her (i.e. going to office hours, going up to the board, etc.) don't expect much help from the professor.","McLaughlin is a nice woman. However, she moves really fast and she doesn't clarify very well. It is extremely hard if you've never been exposed to Calculus concepts before. Tons of Webassign homework. Three hard midterms. Final can replace one of them. The important thing is to have a good recitation leader; they can really help you understand.","Lectures are her explaining and working out problems. Sometimes quizzes are given in recitation but its just more working out problems. Doesn't give partial credit. Claims you need to read the book in order to pass the test. Personally, not true. Read it once and it wasn't much help. Web Assign takes a very long time to finish. Tests are a bit hard","Terrible writing on the blackboard. She teaches really fast sometimes makes me confused.","she expects you to know a lot of stuff  prior to taking her class","I took calculus in high school and came in with a pretty good understanding. Somehow, through the course of the semester, I actually became more confused than I have ever been before. McLaughlin took the material I thought I knew, and explaining it in the worst way possible, managed to un-teach me all of it.","WebAssign is easy and helpful if you put in the time. She is willing to help if you come to class. Tests are very fair--more so than other calculus professors. Taking her for 232 next semester and would recommend. Class is a breeze if you had Calculus in high school.","While she is probably the easiest Math 231 professor, she's also the worst professor. Do not take McLaughlin if you have no calc background because she won't help much. She's confusing and does random example problems without explaining the concepts. This is the only class where my recitation actually helped because I had no idea what was going on.","Do not take math 231 with this professor.  She is very scatterbrained and her class is impossible. I got an A in AP Calc in high school and math was my strongest subject before now. I didn't get above a 54 on any test, including the final this year.","One of those math professors that, when doing practice problems, does not know how to explain what she is doing and why she is doing it.  Likes to skip steps when solving.  test avg has never been over 53. If you like math, don't take her because she can't teach you anything; if you don't like math, don't take her because you will fail her class.","I don't know if I am missing something with all of these previous ratings, but I am currently failing calculus and I have attended every class and have lived in office hours, relying on my TA to teach me the stuff she never taught us yet tests us on. She goes way too fast and expects us to already know everything, and her tests are HARSHY graded!","She is terrible. Very scatterbrained and flaky, and not good at explaining anything. The only good thing about my class is that I have an excellent TA, but it sucks that he's basically teaching us everything because she's so bad at her job. I don't know how I will pass this class. Avoid her at all costs unless you like being confused.","Not really a math person but I absolutely loved  McLaughlin. She was incredibly clear during lectures and made the material very easy to understand. The WebAssign is usually hard, but the answers can be found online and in the book. The problems on the exam are much easier and if you know the class examples and homework, its easy to make an A or A-","She goes pretty fast. Although very intelligent, not prepared for class at times. She did a whole problem on the board and never solved it. She changes homework dates a few times which sometimes doesn't help.","She is pretty clear in explaining her expectations, helpful and inspirational. Homework is lot more harder than test themselves but if you attend lectures and do homework properly than you should be fine with all her tests. I would definitely recommend taking her!","Excellent teacher. If you have to take calc I definitely recommend her.","McLaughlin is one of my favorite professors: she is extremely clear and is quite nice. Her tests are 'easy', but she gives no partial credit for your answers even if you make the smallest mistake, so averages are in the 60s. Also, the bottom third of the class drops, so the curves go away after the first midterm which is annoying."],"courses":["MATH233","MATH232","MATH232","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH231","MAT231","MATH231","MATH231","231","MATH231","MATH231","MATH233"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":610,"class_nbr":13250,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"M","time":"08","instructor":"Kiers,Claire Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":25,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":611,"class_nbr":13251,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"M","time":"09","instructor":"Kiers,Claire Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":27,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":612,"class_nbr":13252,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0381","days":"M","time":"10","instructor":"Keeler,Blake James","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":27,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":613,"class_nbr":13253,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Mitchell","room":"0009","days":"M","time":"11","instructor":"Keeler,Blake James","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":30,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":616,"class_nbr":13256,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"W","time":"09","instructor":"Kiers,Claire Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":29,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":615,"class_nbr":13255,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"W","time":"08","instructor":"Kiers,Claire Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":20,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":614,"class_nbr":13254,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0224","days":"M","time":"12","instructor":"Besson,Marc J","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":28,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":617,"class_nbr":13257,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"W","time":"10","instructor":"Keeler,Blake James","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":30,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":618,"class_nbr":13258,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Carolina Hall","room":"0104","days":"W","time":"11","instructor":"Keeler,Blake James","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":26,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":619,"class_nbr":13259,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Recitation","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0228","days":"W","time":"12","instructor":"Besson,Marc J","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["QR"],"enrl_cap":30,"enrl_tot":30,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":231,"section":1,"class_nbr":2137,"title":"CALC FUNC ONE VAR I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0215","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"Green,Linda Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["CTOPS"],"enrl_cap":148,"enrl_tot":145,"wait_cap":15,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1934646","fname":"Linda","lname":"Green","quality":"4.3","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"Caring (5)","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","INSPIRATIONAL","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","INSPIRATIONAL","HILARIOUS","RESPECTED","INSPIRATIONAL","CARING","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","RESPECTED"],"comments":["Linda Green was a wonderful teacher. I started off bombing my homework and tests, but by the end of the semester I made an A on the last test. She is very easy to understand and cares a lot about her students. My advice is to really brush up on integration before the class starts so that the first unit doesn't overwhelm you.","Tests are difficult as are quizzes in recitation. Lecture can get dry and when participation is low, it can be hard to focus and grasp the material. Linda is a great person who is really passionate about math, but sometimes she goes on and on when the class isnt really alert. Homework on Webassign helps learn the material and going back over ppts","I. Love. Linda. Green. This class was tough, but she is an amazing teacher! If you have to take this course, take it with her! However, if it is not required for you, don't take it, as it can definitely tank your GPA. She is one of the best math professors at UNC","Best Math teacher I've ever had in my life!","This class sucked. Yes she is a great lecturer and really loves Calculus, but the tests and quizzes are really hard. She loves true/false so I've warned ya, don't take it unless absolutely necessary and if you kinda know calc already","Dr. Green is the best math teacher I've had! I hated math with a passion before this class and now I'm actually enjoying classwork!  Lectures focus on understanding concepts, so practice harder calculations on your own (webassigns are helpful for this), but if you pay attention to lectures you will understand concepts easily! Absolutely love her!","Greatest class ever. I legitimately showed up to half the classes and I'm about to pull a 95+. You may think that is because I'm some super genius (I wish) or that I already took Calc 3, but NO. Linda's class is simply THAT effective. I recommend.","LINDA GREEN IS THE GREATEST! If you want any chance at passing calculus at UNC, you need Linda Green as your professor. Her lectures are well thought out, get students involved in the material, and explain the concepts in ways that actually make sense. Calculus is very hard and without Linda Green I would have failed. She actually cares.","Oh my God. I love Linda. She's literally my favorite person ever. She gets so passionate about math, and she is down to earth.
