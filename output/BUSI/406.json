Professor. Full of himself and grading is completely subjective.","Pretty good lecturer. Huge ego and will talk about himself almost every class. While this class is generally easy, the tests and semester long group project basically determine your final grade. Reading not totally necessary, but definitely makes things easier.","He's a decent teacher but is completely full of himself and won't stop telling you his accomplishments the whole semester. Class isn't too hard though","This class was a waste of time. Didow's lectures were off-topic most of the time and boring. His grading criteria is completely subjective and unclear. I learned nothing truly applicable to global marketing from this class. I truly believe Didow knows his stuff and is a nice guy, he is just not a good teacher.","Fantastic professor! Very enthusiastic and tries to get the class engaged. Clearly a great guy, funny and cares about the subject. Read the Friedman book and you'll be good, not too much emphasis on textbook.","Great professor, knows his stuff down to the T. Will give you a run for your money, but without question one of the best the business school has to offer! TAKE HIM!!","Great professor, clear, concise, and straight to the point. Will challenge you throughout semester but it is definitely worth it!","Prof. Didow is one of the best I've had in the Bschool...great all around."],"courses":["BUSI406","BUSI406","BUSI406","BUSI406","617","BUSI617","CNSMR001","CNSMB001","BUSI617"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWFUL","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
