We didn't have a single test for the entire semester, just papers and performances. The class is discussion based, so it is crucial that you go and participate. There are lots of group performances, but he gives really good feedback! I would definitely recommend his class!"],"courses":["COMM63"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
