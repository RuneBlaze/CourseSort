She's irreverent and funny and just about all the things you want in a professor.  You do have to do the reading, but the syllabus is great, so it's not like it's a hassle.  A plus plus plus.","Do yourself a favor and take her class, she's supermegafoxyawesome. It is essential that you do the reading, because the discussions won't give you the info. You'll want to know where your towel is even if you don't feel like participating. Really, really funny and a fantastic teacher.  Grade is from papers/final and her grading isn't harsh at all.","Do not leave UNC without taking a class with this woman! Her classes are so interesting and she's a great teacher and she's hilarious! Classes are pretty much self-guided discussion, which is great if you enjoy that. Def need to participate in class so make sure you do the reading - she might ask for your opinion. AWESOME LADY!","Excellent syllabus, good mix of theory and literature, extremely knowledgeable about the subject.  Her comments on papers were very useful, and she is very good at guiding research projects.  I hope to take another class with her.","Watch your grammar and citations on papers! Also, the discussions tend to be a little unguided, make sure you comprehend the main issues in the books."],"courses":["ENGL356","ENGL121","ENGL356","ENGL356","ENGL355","ENGL390","ENGL92C"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
