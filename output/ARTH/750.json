Still not quite sure what I have learned or was suppose to learn. Literally got our first grade on the very last day of class.","I was super excited about taking this class, but it was not what I had hoped it would be. I am still wondering what the real objective was. Lectures were somewhat boring. Professor Magee is professional and fair. I wish the class had a bit more spice and/or flair to it.","Yes, this class is hard. Yes, she grades hard. If you are looking for an easy road through college then avoid Magee. However, if you are interested in improving your critical thinking and writing skills while learning about something esoteric yet interesting, consider taking this class with Magee. It also satisfies a truckload of Gen Ed requirement","This class was the bane of my existence. Her lectures are extremely dry and hard to follow. She grades EXTREMELY hard. Classes are either lecture or group discussions. Group discussions include forced discussion about boring readings. SHOULD be an interesting class but IS NOT. DO NOT TAKE.","This class was crap. Barely related to art at all and she graded so hard it was next to impossible to get an A, even with extra credit. Lectures were super boring and she was really hateful too. Bottom line, if you take art stay away from Magee!!","I have taken two classes with her and she is amazing. A presentation and some response papers is pretty much all she grades on. Pretty easy material, some reading, but very interesting too. She is the nicest woman also! Very helpful and kind.","I have taken two classes with her and she is amazing.

He is also extremely compassionate towards his students and tries to help them out as much as he can. Enjoyed being in his class although this was my first time taking any art history class.","Great class. Bowles is really passionate and knowledgeable about this era. The assignments are 2 essays, 2 reading responses, 2 outside event responses, and a take-home final. He's very easy to talk to and ready to help you write for any of those assignments.","This class was a great class for your first semester of freshman year. Loved the simplicity of it and how well he works with you and prepares you for your future at UNC. Solid class. Super easy as well","It was a fairly easy class. He knows alot of stuff about African American art and he's not afraid to show it! But I do have to say he was sometimes reaallly boring. Sometimes you would go in there and see half the class asleep. Very easy A however, and you learn a handful of things about art as well.","Absolutely recommend ART 287 with Bowles. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about the class and makes it interesting. Grading is 2 short papers, 2 outside event responses, essay midterm and final, and recitation participation - workload of a 100-level class, so an A is very doable. TAs will also read/comment on papers before turning in.","He is a good teacher and has a wealth of information about Art History as a whole. The class was slightly long but he regularly ends class early and is helpful with assignments.","This class was a first-year seminar on African-American Art in the Carolinas. It was interesting and an easy A. I usually went twice a week to class, even though it takes place three times a week, and still did great. Bowles is also a super nice professor.","Prof. Bowles was my FYS teacher on African American Art in the Carolinas. The class was suprisingly interesting and he always had us do different activities instead of just always writing papers. It is an easy A, even though its alot of work. I have learned so much in his class, by far one of the best teachers at unc."],"courses":["ARTH485","ARTH485","ARTH061","AAAD330","ART287","ART61","ART061","AFAM061"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ARTH","catalog_nbr":750,"section":195,"class_nbr":9671,"title":"ADV READINGS IN ART HIST","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"ROVINE,VICTORIA L.","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2089624","fname":"Victoria","lname":"Rovine","quality":"5.0","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"Participation matters (2)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["PARTICIPATION MATTERS","GET READY TO READ","PARTICIPATION MATTERS"],"comments":["I love Professor Rovine!!  Super interesting first year seminar.  She really catered the course to first year students, which was nice.  We had discussions about all the readings but you don't necessarily have to read to participate.  I found the material very interesting so I did read.  She is extremely qualified and a great lecturer.","A truly excellent teacher, her enthusiasm for the subject matter is infectious and she is very capable of leading a productive class lecture and discussion.","I absolutely love Rovine. She is extremely sweet and helps you grasp her love for Africa. Do not skip class and participate or you will lose points from overall grade. There is a midterm and final; and a research paper.
