He is also extremely compassionate towards his students and tries to help them out as much as he can. Enjoyed being in his class although this was my first time taking any art history class.","Great class. Bowles is really passionate and knowledgeable about this era. The assignments are 2 essays, 2 reading responses, 2 outside event responses, and a take-home final. He's very easy to talk to and ready to help you write for any of those assignments.","This class was a great class for your first semester of freshman year. Loved the simplicity of it and how well he works with you and prepares you for your future at UNC. Solid class. Super easy as well","It was a fairly easy class. He knows alot of stuff about African American art and he's not afraid to show it! But I do have to say he was sometimes reaallly boring. Sometimes you would go in there and see half the class asleep. Very easy A however, and you learn a handful of things about art as well.","Absolutely recommend ART 287 with Bowles. He is very knowledgeable and passionate about the class and makes it interesting. Grading is 2 short papers, 2 outside event responses, essay midterm and final, and recitation participation - workload of a 100-level class, so an A is very doable. TAs will also read/comment on papers before turning in.","He is a good teacher and has a wealth of information about Art History as a whole. The class was slightly long but he regularly ends class early and is helpful with assignments.","This class was a first-year seminar on African-American Art in the Carolinas. It was interesting and an easy A. I usually went twice a week to class, even though it takes place three times a week, and still did great. Bowles is also a super nice professor.","Prof. Bowles was my FYS teacher on African American Art in the Carolinas. The class was suprisingly interesting and he always had us do different activities instead of just always writing papers. It is an easy A, even though its alot of work. I have learned so much in his class, by far one of the best teachers at unc."],"courses":["ARTH485","ARTH485","ARTH061","AAAD330","ART287","ART61","ART061","AFAM061"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
