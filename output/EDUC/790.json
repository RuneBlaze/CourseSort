However, he is not very funny, although he thinks he is, and lectures are long. The second half of the semester was all group work and we didn't even have class for like 2 straight weeks because of this group work. Easy A but this class and Dr. Hughes will bore your brains out."],"courses":["EDUC508"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE"]}}]
