Although she is a very tough professor, it is worth taking her because you learn so much.  She definitely expects a lot but she always makes everything very clear and she is always willing to help!","Her lectures are taught as though you read the book and perfectly understood everything. She wants class to be more discussion/practice than teaching, but that's ineffective when you only meet 10 times a semester for an hour and a half. Her tests are tricky and she doesn't give you much direction in studying for the final. Luckily, she will curve.","Dr. Sathy is by far the best, most invested professor I have had here at UNC. She puts so much into this class it's amazing. The class is hard and definitely requires being prepared, going to class every day and taking really good notes. Dr. Sathy is amazing, hands-down would take again","Sathy has a bad reputation for being a tough psyc professor but I had a great experience with her. The lab assignments (there are many but you get a lot of guidance) really help offset the final exam which is nice considering I thought I was going to fail the final. However, I went to her lectures and knew more of the study guide than anticipated.","Long lab reports in your future","Just not a fun class. Very work-heavy, and none of it is interesting.","worst prof ever in UNC. My psyc GPA used to be a 4.0, after this class it dropped to 3.8. Hate this class. TA was never helpful, and they pretend they know everything most of the time, using big words. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS unless you are a senior or about to graduate and don't care about your GPA.","Dr. Sathy was one of the best profs I had! She is supppper caring and has a passion for education. 270 is a tough course so expect to write long reports and keep up with the reading (most students dont). The final exam is solely from the lectures so be sure to take notes and do the readings beforehand to better understand in class. Final was tough.","The book was very different from her lectures.  She lectured us assuming we had knowledge of the material.  Her notes are based off questions she asks so it's impossible to review for tests.  Her classes have single-handedly dropped my PSYC average from an A to a B-/C+ just from how she handles the material.  More confusing, less learning.","She literally never taught anything and magically expected us to know everything for the final after having class maaaybe 10 times a semester. Never uploaded the lecture slides. Acts like she's super nice and helpful but nothing she did helped me learn anything in this class, it was all my lab section or learning everything on my own.","Dr. Sathy is a great professor! She is super helpful. I really enjoyed this class.","Best professor I have ever had. She is extremely knowledgeable and cares about the success of her students. She makes class fun and enjoyable and I would recommend her as a professor to anyone who wants to learn. She is challenging but has a way of making the most challenging of tasks seem manageable.","She's beyond awesome. I love her use of technology in the classroom. Super helpful, but I would highly recommend coming prepared!","Took 210 with Sathy and intentionally took 270 with her. She tells you exactly what she wants you to know for the exam but doesn't give you the powerpoints in 270, so attend and take notespics of slides. I notecarded the lectures and missed 2 q's on the final. Majority of grade is from Lab, where you just do the damn work and should be fine.","Dr. Sathy uses a unique structure that frustrated me at first, but eventually I got the hang of it. (I think most students) do most of the learning at home, by watching video tutorials. Class-time is more application based, where you get to practice what you learned at home. If you take the time to watch the videos, you'll do well like I did.","Dr. Sathy is by far the best professor I've ever had. Her class is challenging, but she motivated me to try my best and I got an A-. She goes WAY above and beyond for her students. If you go to class and use the ample resources she provides, you'll actually LEARN and the class won't be a waste of time. I cannot recommend Dr. Sathy highly enough.","I'm really torn on my opinion of Dr. Sathy. She's a really nice lady and she really does seem to truly care about her students. She went above and beyond a few times this semester to make sure students were able to get the material. However, I feel like she makes the class difficult. I've had stats before and I'm still just hoping for a C.","Dr. Sathy is an amazing person. She cares so much about student learning and it really shows. I love how she relates what we do to real applications of statistics. Whiners aren't up to the challenge and aren't really ready to learn. She's won lots of teaching awards too.","Dr. Sathy is a very outgoing person but teaching-wise, she and I did not synchronize. As mentioned, she can sometimes be condescending and she makes the material more difficult than necessary. If you have to take 210, take Jordan.  Sathy is a really nice person, but her class is probably one of the worst classes I've taken at UNC. Try to avoid.. ):","Dr. Sathy is one of the WORST professors I've ever had! She is condescending and impatient when you ask questions, she has \"phantom points.\" If you don't answer a question a certain way, you don't get the point ( the point is a part of the test grade, not extra credit). She & her TAs write questions  - & they've admitted this - TRYING to trick you."],"courses":["PSYC210","PSYC270","PSYC210","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","PSYC270","210","PSYC270","210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210","PSYC210"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR"]}}]
