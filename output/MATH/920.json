However, he fails to clearly communicate many of the ideas he wishes to teach in class, and I learned more reading outside papers on the topics discussed than I did from his lectures or notes. He is also an incredible tough grader and can be very derisive towards questions he feels are inane.","The course is demanding, and he has no interest in holding your hand. He often belittled those who asked questions in class, creating an environment where everyone was afraid to speak up.  Not a nice guy.  That said, he lectures well.
