You need to come to every class to understand the material. This is not a class you can study for the day before the exam. The weekly book quizzes are important also. The best thing to do is make flashcards for everything and get in a study group.","One of the hardest classes I've ever taken.  Interesting, but the whole semester felt rushed to pack as much in as possible.","Dr. Packer is fair but hard. Make this class your top priority if you have her as a professor. Don't ever, ever, ever be late for her class.","Do not show up late for class. Do not sleep in class. These things will get you thrown out. Also, make sure to participate or she'll call on you when you don't know the answer. She did that to me, and then picked on me the entire semester.","Very interesting class, made me want to become a lawyer.  Difficult tests, ALL writing, must know info frontwards, backwards, inside and out.  Also its not just facts, but how you apply facts to a case.","Dr. Packer is a very good teacher, but do not go to her class unprepared and don't be late!","Hard class, but she is an amazing professor. She keeps you awake and interested in the class. If you go to her office hours or to her TA's office hours they will fully explain anything you need help with, take advantage of those even if you don't usually. Her tests are hard, but straightforward. Take her over anyone else for sure!","I loved media law purely because of her teaching style--she makes it interesting and funny. Although the exams are hard, they're no guessing game or surprise. If you study what's on the guide, then you'll do fine. And she's very fair with grading, especially if you sit towards the front of the class and make a comment every now and then.","Beware: likes to single students out for no apparent reason/ no educational purpose.","No Comments"],"courses":["JOMC340","JOMC164","JOMC440","JOMC740","JOMC340","JOMC740","JOMC164","JOMC164","JOURNALSIM","ETHICS"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
