It was performance of lit. I made an easy A and am a horrible actor. If you want a GPA booster- this is it. Everything is graded by the TA. 4 papers and performances make up the grade. Really easy!","Paul seems like a nice guy and the class is easy enough, but he seems to be hard on the TA's, who really do all the work.  You can see why he's in drama since he never listens to anyone's reasoning but his own.  Kind of cold-hearted.","One of the best teachers I've ever had.","No Comments","if don't expect much, you might not be let down","I graduated in 98, but Paul was my favorite prof. by far; he will go out of his way to help you; even help you start a career. Took LOTS of classes from him.","Paul is a nice guy and definitely loves the material he's teaching.  My problem with the class was trying to understand what the point was.  I felt as though the lectures did not improve my performance abilities at all and am just glad it's over!","Had Paul Ferguson a long time ago.  He was organized, rigorous, inspiring, and enthusiatic.  He adapted well to his audience and explained concepts using theory, but making the theory relavant and tangible to the audience.  A quality professor.","I had a few class with paul and he is the man... Loves what he teaches and love being with the students.. And he has a hot wife and he will let you know it too...","i heart paul with all my being. granted hes not the most organized person, but he has a zest for the subject and life. if you want to have fun and be challenged take a class with him.","he's great if you don't depend on him to keep his promises, prefer your teacher not to have any sort of organizational skills, and like when your teacher shows favor to the beautiful girls in class.","there are no words to describe how great paul is!","The best prof EVER!!!  So much fun!"],"courses":["COMM263","COMM","COMM60","COMM","COMM","COM60","COMM60","SPE041","COMM63","COMM60","COMM","COMM","COMM60"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
