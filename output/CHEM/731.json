She was very enthusiastic, as she herself had pioneered fluorescence techniques.  She was very patient, explained the technical aspects of microscopy with great clarity &  taught us to read scientific literature with a critical eye.","Very boring lecturer, doesn't know what she is talking about sometimes.  If you read the book and do the mastering you will pass without going to a single lecture.  Powerpoints are all posted online","You don't learn anything in this class. She rambles on abut things that don't pertain to what you need to learn and her tests are extra hard for no reason. She even said she made the test too long for the time we are given and still made us take the test. I would not take her as a professor at all. Avoid at all costs","This is literally the worst teacher I've had at Carolina. I did well in the class, but I worked harder in this class than I did in Math 383- Differential Equations. You basically have to teach yourself everything. She is not clear and you can tell that she doesn't care. Avoid her like the plague.","Worst professor possible.  You don't receive formula sheets, she doesn't provide practice tests, and she acts dismissive in office hours.  ANYONE would be better than Thompson.  Tests are 10+ pages with the final exam over 20 pages long.  The kicker is that she's tough and you don't learn anything since she reads off of the powerpoint.","Terrible professor. She provides no practice tests or even study guides for her exams. She does the bare minimum for the course. Her lectures are dull and monotone and she never clearly articulates what you should know. Would definitely not recommend her unless you enjoy learning everything on your own.","I would avoid taking this class. The lectures do not help at all, but luckily attendance is not required. Her lectures are monotone and confusing. They also have unnecessary mathematical and biological information on them. You basically have to teach yourself with the book problems."],"courses":["CHEM733","CHEM102","CHEM102","CHEM102","CHEM102","CHEM102","CHEM102"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR"]}}]
