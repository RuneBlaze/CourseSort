If you don't understand something, he will explain it again and again (in a different way each time), until you understand it. He encourages questions, and is a very fair professor.","When you are new to the material, you may get a sense that Sean's explanations are hasty and incomplete but you'll second guess yourself: \"maybe it's just me, maybe I should focus on this lecture and then I'll get it\". Wrong - his explanations truly are hasty and incomplete. Come to class, take detailed notes, but learn from TEXTBOOKS W SOLUTIONS!","Respectable professor. If you need help, he will make time. Behind the sarcasm, he's a great professor.","Horrible lecturer.  Makes you feel terrible for asking questions. Avoid.","Made it clear from day 1 he didn't care about this class or anyone in it. Scheduled appointments with him 4 times and he didn't bother to show up every time.","One of the best professors at the University.","Boo.","I had a lot of trouble in this class but I'm not a Physics person. Sometimes he didn't explain things very well. But he was really nice and laid back. A lot of people got As and Bs in there.","Sean is a very awsome and funny guy, however he was a pretty horrible 101 teacher (but he hates that class, so he is a much better teacher in 103).  He makes you feel like he hates answering your questions and that you are really really dumb, but in fact he loves when you ask him questions and just likes picking on you, that's his natural state :P.","Very approachable and friendly. Truly cares about you understanding the material. Lectures are difficult to decipher sometimes, and he has a habit of making you feel dumb if you don't immediately grasp concepts.
