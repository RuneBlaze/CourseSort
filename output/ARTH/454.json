Beneath a somewhat intimidating exterior, he is a very nice person and one of the smartest art history professors. His classes are discussion driven. Sometimes students ask questions he did not know the answer to. He makes a point to thoroughly investigate the question and report back to class.","You have to participate to do well. Don't let him scare you. The cultural barrier can be hard at times.","Very arrogant and expects you to have a thorough understanding of northern european art or just art in general already. Not afraid to make you feel stupid if you your answer isn't what he is looking for","It was by no means an easy class and you will be forced to talk in class because he will call on you. If you can be analytical and take good notes, you won't have a problem. As for exams, you will have to recall a lot of details so if you hate art this will be difficult. I personally found him to be a wonderful professor though.","He's German, so there are some language barriers, but he's nice you just have to ask him to repeat or explain things and he will. I thought he graded papers very easily, but I didn't study for the exams which is where I messed up. Overall I thought he was a fine professor and the class was easy. I've definitely had more difficult arth classes.","You have to recall every single minute detail about any topic or painting in the course to do well on his exams. Ridiculously high expectations for the exams. Also, there's a bit of a cultural barrier--he's German."],"courses":["ARTH272","ARTH384","HIST366","ARTH365","ARTH272","ART274"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
