And football was 11-3 this year so that's a plus but yeah","Awesome Band Director; made marching band extremely fun","Sometimes interesting, but can be very boring, because the concepts are really basic/common sense. Lecturers change as the topics change. Easy A. If you're looking to have fun interacting with music, this is not the course. Lots of listening to people talk, not much with actual pieces of music.","How he knows everybody's name in the span of a few months is beyond me. Great guy, marching band is fantastic with him.","Wonderful Guy! Cares about every single student! Super funny!","Fuchs is a great band director and really makes people excited about band.","It's marching band, do as you're told, show up on time, and HAVE FUN!   GET UP OFFA THAT THING, JEFF FUCHS!","awesome!","AMAZING dude. Seriously, best professor in the entire school. Fun, efficient, and could probably give you the name of every member of the marching band.","Jeff Fuchs is the best band director I've ever had. He's efficient and fun at the same time. He is a true Tar Heel!","Great director.  Expects a lot of effort from everybody.","Fuchs is great! Best director one could have.","Marching Band Rocks!  He's great at controlling the group and on top of that he's a nice guy.","he is just so great. he is so informative and there for you when you need help.","Best band director ever!","Fuchs is an incredible director, and always available, but very political in selecting his leaders.","No Comments","Prof. Fuchs always has a handle on what the symphony band needs, even when the athletic bands (which he is in charge of) have a bunch of things on the schedule.  He has a lot of class and character.  Always available when we need him.
