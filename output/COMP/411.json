An engaging lecturer who likes to walk around the hall and engage students with questions. He's very kind, but cares immensely about fairness. To engage outside of class, he catered dinner with self-selected groups of students throughout the semester.","Professor Fuchs is extremely passionate about comp sci. You can tell he's talented. However, this class was a pain in a butt. You would have to spend 4-10 hours in office hours because Fuchs could never teach. His lectures were about everything but what was needed for the assignment. Don't take this class. Great people, too much time.","He gives quizzes every week, that are just as hard as his tests. I went to every class, and studied before every quiz, yet had a quiz average of 55. Btw, I'm pretty good at computer science (got an A in Comp110, and an A in comp401 & 410). Tests are extremely hard. Even after the curve the average is in the 60s. And he's terrible at explanations.","This is a hard class, and the lectures feel long. If you don't understand something in the lecture, it's impossible to understand the rest of the lecture. He is very enthusiastic and nice. He frequently calls on people to answer questions.","Incredible professor - very involved and passionate, very clear in explanations (to the point where I'd zone out after a bit, but hey - I couldn't stay awake through a lecture if it was Will Ferrell up there), and insisted on having small group dinners with every person in the class - in a LECTURE HALL class.  Great professor, highly recommend."],"courses":["COMP411","COMP60H","COMP411","COMP411","CS411"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
