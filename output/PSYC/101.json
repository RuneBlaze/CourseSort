The class was interesting but wasn't enough to hold my attention that well. Lots of online assignments and beware new people taking his class: he doesn't give you hints for when stuff is due. A lot of group work and his big project is ridiculous. Make sure you pick a team that wants a great grade.","LOVED him. Great professor and really made the material come to life and interesting.","He is an awesome professor. There are many assignments, but they are really helpful. You will learn a lot throughout the semester.","Buzinski is a pretty funny guy, he makes the lectures enjoyable. He gives a lot of extra credit opportunities, definitely do all of them. Do not forget to complete his quizzes on Sakai, I missed two and my grade definitely hurt from that. He assigns one big project, it's pretty intense for the level of the class but not impossible to do well on it.","Awesome professor with interesting lectures.  Read the book and do the worksheets and you'll do good on the exams.  Two question quiz at the beginning of every class-easy points to boost your grade.  The group project is the worst part of the class and was 17% of the grade.  If there wasn't a group project, I would take another one of his classes.","He's a pretty good professor. Probably not my favorite, but he's an approachable person. Definitely eye-candy and great to listen to, but sometimes I'd be a little confused at the concepts he would explain. We had probably 4 guest lecturers (3 TA's) which really influenced Test 2 badly for me (multiple perspectives). Overall, I'd recommend.","Dr. Buzinski is my favorite professor at UNC! His classes are a lot of work but he's really good at making the subject interesting and engaging so that you actually want to do the work! He's friendly and has a great class structure that places a lot of emphasis on interacting with the students rather than a 50 minute lecture. I highly recommend him","Best class i have taken here with the best professor. He is really engaging and relatable. Also super cute and funny. Keeps you awake and engaged at 8 AM.","Great Professor! Has graded worksheets online that help your grade if you've done the reading. Has good explanations for the different concepts and really likes to make sure the class understands the concepts through questions or group work."],"courses":["PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYC222","PSYC260","PSYC260","PSYCH222","PSYCH101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":101,"section":3,"class_nbr":5815,"title":"GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Hamilton Hall","room":"0100","days":"MWF","time":"11","instructor":"WISS,FREDERICK CHARLES","load":"10","rank":"INST","attributes":["CTOPS"],"enrl_cap":300,"enrl_tot":295,"wait_cap":25,"wait_tot":15,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1939297","fname":"FREDERICK","lname":"WISS","quality":"4.3","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Hilarious (2)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","RESPECTED","GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["I always enjoyed coming to this class.  This is basically a high school psychology class. I slept some lectures.   I didn't go sometimes.  I never read.  I made an A easily. He is a funny guy and is pretty cool.","Read the chapters in the textbook and you'll be fine.","Great Professor! Very clear in lectures and open to questions. Really good at explaining concepts and uses a lot of real world examples so the lecture doesn't get boring. I got a C+ on the first two exams, but I actually studied for the final and got a 93%. It is easy to get an A in the class if you read the text and study for the exams.","Professor Wiss is great! He often shows video clips or movies during lecture, and will sometimes assign a pop \"reaction paper.\" Attendance is important, as he occasionally gives pop-assignments and the exam material comes straight from his lectures. The textbook is helpful, but it mostly just supplements the lectures."],"courses":["PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":101,"section":2,"class_nbr":1581,"title":"GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Stone Center","room":"0103","days":"MWF","time":"14","instructor":"GRIFFIN,DESIREE A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CTOPS"],"enrl_cap":280,"enrl_tot":278,"wait_cap":25,"wait_tot":10,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1886583","fname":"Desiree","lname":"Griffin","quality":"4.2","easiness":"2.1","help":"2.1","clarity":"2.1","topTag":"Amazing lectures (4)","grade":"2.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["EXTRA CREDIT","EXTRA CREDIT","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","EXTRA CREDIT","AMAZING LECTURES","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","TOUGH GRADER","LECTURE HEAVY","GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["I LOVE PROFESSOR GRIFFIN!! She is a fantastic lecturer and the class is very easy.  I didn't study much and got a 99% as my final grade, just keep up with the online homework, the final isn't even cumulative.  The class was an easy A but it was so interesting, and Professor Griffin is entertaining and engaging.  Highly recommend any class with her!","Her class is very engaging and interesting and she is wonderful lecturer. The homework is very reasonable and it gives a helpful outline to be prepared for class and to help with exams.  The exam questions are kind of tricky you just need to read them carefully and really pay attention in class. Overall great class.","Overall great class.","Dr. Griffin was an amazing intro to Psychology. She was very clear in lectures, used PollEv to keep us engaged, and made it very easy to get a good grade. The reading was very reasonable, and she gave guided reading questions for every class. If you do the homework, pay attention during review, and participate, you will get an A.","She gives very interesting lectures and the materials are easy to understand. There is homework before every lecture, but less than my other classes.  HW typically takes 45 minutes to do, and prepares you for lecture and exams. I think exams are a bit tricky, you really have to understand the material not just recite it. She's a wonderful lecturer!","There is textbook reading almost every night, but if you like psychology then it will be fine. She talks very very fast so you have to listen carefully or you will miss information. She is a bubbly person and enjoys her job you can tell.  the exams are not too difficult, but you do need to study a lot because there are some tricky questions!","You know those test questions you read, and your first reaction is:  \"This is just meant to trick me.\" She likes to give a lot of those. My final grade suffered because of that reason, in large part. Ridiculous.","I feel mentally exhausted after sitting through her lectures because she talks sosososo fast. But that's just me.","She is a very clear and engaging professor. Assigns Poll Everywhere questions during class as a way to check attendance. She gives extra credit before exams and the final is not cumulative.","Great teacher, interesting to listen to.","Dr. Griffin is literally the BEST psych teacher I've EVER had. Attendance isn't mandatory, but she gives random quizzes for attendance. She makes the class easy to follow and hard to fail. If you like bubbly teachers... She's perfect."],"courses":["PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC101","PSYC110","PSYCH101","PSYC242","245","PSYC245","PSYC245","PSYC245"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":101,"section":990,"class_nbr":11794,"title":"GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["PL"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"PSYC","catalog_nbr":101,"section":951,"class_nbr":13580,"title":"GENERAL PSYCHOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Davie","room":"0101","days":"MW","time":"19","instructor":"ADAMS,ELIZABETH A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["PL"],"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":13,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2138260","fname":"Elizabeth","lname":"Adams","quality":"5.0","easiness":"4.5","help":"4.5","clarity":"4.5","topTag":"Clear grading criteria (1)","grade":"4.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["CARING","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA"],"comments":["This was my favorite class that I have taken so far this semester. I really learned something and she just wants you to do well. I am going to take more of her classes in the future. Highly recommended.","Dr. Adams is a very sweet professor. She really cares more about students scoring well on tests than about making the material hard. Coming to class is important and her tests are passed directly on class powerpoints. She has a review before every test with some of the test questions. She gives online quizzes (easy) and randomly takes attendance."],"courses":["PSYC250","PSYC250"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
