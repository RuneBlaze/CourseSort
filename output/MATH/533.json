He lectures straight from the book. He wasn't a very good lecturer, but he was very active in office hours.  Office hours weren't the most helpful (due to the fact a lot of people came, and it was hard to get individual attention). His tests are fair and the homework is reasonable in length and difficulty.","I liked this class a lot.  I thought it was pretty easy and the homework was actually based on what he did in class, which I thought he explained well.","This was not a hard class, but when I didn't understand concepts, he couldn't (or wouldn't) explain things in a different way so that I might understand, he just repeated himself.  NOT HELPFUL.  English wasn't first language, took awhile to get a hang of his accent.  Lectures tended to be abstract, and difficult to follow (and I'm a math major).  It's a requirement for my major, if it's not for yours...don't take it.  And if you can avoid it...don't take him.","No Comments","No Comments","EXTREMELY good teacher and very fair"],"courses":["MATH381","MATH81","MATH81","MATH83","MATH83","MATH83"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
