When it came time for the exam, we were given our reading syllabus as a study guide. Probably the most maddening class I've taken at Carolina. Avoid.","Horrible class. Dr. Watts cancelled class over 10 times, which is completely unacceptable. Lectures complicated and doesn't discuss many questions that you find in the tests.  If you're a COMM major, take it with someone else. Probably one of the worst I've had at UNC.","Dr. Watts is a very good professor if you're willing to participate in class. He cancels class at least once every two weeks. I didn't do readings AT ALL and I made a B+ on the first exam. He's very fun and one of my favorites by far.","THIS IS A HORRIBLE PROFESSOR! There are not enough characters unfortunately, but basically he doesn't show up to class, and when he does, he makes easy material convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. I am an Honors student and expected an easy A- had to drop the course bc our \"study guide\" for the one midterm was our readings syllabus. AVOID!!","Eric is very enthusiastic about teaching. His lectures are interesting and he likes student involvement. Eric's class was one of my favorites taken at UNC."],"courses":["COMM170","COMM170","COMM170","COMM170","COMM679"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
