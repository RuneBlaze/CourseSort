The hardest part about it was sitting through the 2 and a half hour discussions on the movies we watched the previous class. Very easy to get a good grade, there are 3 papers due throughout the semester comprising 40% of grade and the final is open everything and she gives you the questions ahead of time.","Conover was a great lecturer. She's knowledgeable, funny, and very explicit about what she expects from you. Her lectures were straightforward, interesting and she sent out study guides in advance so that you could prepare for the tests way ahead of time without any curveballs. I would definitely take another class with her!","I took this class so that I could learn about US government. I actually ended up learning about current social issues. This class doesn't have that much outside work and not really any homework because you don't actually have to read all of the NYT's articles she assigns. I would take this class with a different prof. She curved my test grade down.","This class was more difficult than I expected, and if I had looked on this site, I would not have taken it. The grading scale is tough, the lectures are boring. The class is centered around the New York Times and you actually have to pay for a weekly subscription. The recitations are good, and getting a good TA is important for passing.","She isn't a terrible teacher but she's not great either. Definitely one of those middle aged people that thinks our generation and technology are ruining the world. Her lectures, while not particularly engaging or interesting, are clear. Lectures are optional but  go and take notes on what she says, not just her powerpoints. Required NYT reading.","She is very politically inclined and that is made clear in her teaching. I had a hard time expressing my own opinions in the small group setting.","This class was by no means easy, but her lectures were very engaging, and if you do your work, you can surely get an A. Getting a good TA really matters and participating in recitation discussions helps your grade (and it wouldn't hurt to take notes during them). I had Mr Petrash and he was great. But go to lectures and take good notes for sure!","Not very understanding at all.","Watching movies is great and this class is not hard at all, but once Conover starts to lecture, I lose all interest. She teaches like a high school teacher, has the least helpful power points imaginable, and will shut down anyone's ideas that do not align with hers. It's not a hard class at all, but I just can't handle her as a professor.","I think if I were to have read some of the most recent ratings before I took this class, I wouldn't have taken it and would have missed out on a great class. Granted, this class is far from an easy A, but Conover knows what she is talking about and if you put in the work you will reap the benefits.","Go ahead and switch your professor now. Interesting course, but she is really tough. Lectures are somewhat interesting, but the amount of work you put in outside the classroom is ridiculous. Instead of being graded on your New York TImes comprehension level, read it for fun and switch to an easier professor.","Hated this class.  Lectures are actually fairly interesting but are biased and have nothing to do with the rest of the class. The exams and papers are completely based off of the NY Times, which makes it more difficult.  Would NOT recommend this professor.","Connover's class on the surface is very simple. I went into the first exam with a high level of confidence and left with the same amount. I thought I aced the test no questions about it. I was shocked when I received a 68. TA do everything and are the most strict graders I have EVER experienced. Run for the hills if you receive Martin Caver. Horrid","She gives good lectures, but that's about the extent of what's good about taking her class. The class in general is very hard and time consuming. Work for her class includes reading the NYT (which all papers and tests are based on), 2 exams, 2 papers, 4 quizzes, and  online discussions. Don't take this class if you already have a tough schedule.","Interesting lectures, clear and organized. I don't understand why EVERYTHING has to be taken from NYT for papers and exams. Worst part of this course is you have to pass 3/4 book quizzes (which are pretty difficult) to even get at least a B+","Unless you want to pay for a New York Times article and learn somely about ONLY the NYT, DON'T TAKE THE CLASS. Conover knows her stuff and the lectures are fairly interesting, but outside lecture the only thing you do is talk about the NYT. All exams and papers are based only on the NYT. I honestly left the class knowing the same as when i started.","Conover does know her stuff, but she is biased. I came into the class wanting to major in poli sci, but changed my mind after the class. There are only 4 graded assignments, and when I took it, the TA graded unfairly. I think she's a great teacher, but the class is too hard to do well.","Before finalS I was in the hospital. I made plans to retake it. Conover emailed me saying come either tuesday or thursday during office to retake it. I was back home and out of state so I emailed her back thursday and she didn't reply. When I arrived she cussed me out saying I was stupid to come when she didn't respond. HORRIBLE PERSON AND TEACHER!","Pamela Conover is a horrid professor. She knows her stuff, but she's so biased that I found it hard to take anything she said seriously. I learned a lot about how George Bush is the devil, and how the evil white man is continuing to keep everyone else down. I was going to major in poli before I took this course. Conover changed my mind.","Professor Conover knows her stuff. Keeps class engaging. Never thought I would like poli sci but she changed my mind. Keep in mind, the class is not a walk in the park unless you put some effort in... except for the book quizzes. Those are exorbitantly difficult, so read your book for detail."],"courses":["POLI50","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI79","POLI100","POLI100","POLI50","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100","POLI100"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":890,"section":12,"class_nbr":9377,"title":"DIRECT READING/POLI","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"VACHUDOVA,MILADA A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=319805","fname":"Milada","lname":"Vachudova","quality":"4.1","easiness":"2.6","help":"2.6","clarity":"2.6","topTag":"","grade":"2.6","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":[],"comments":["Super nice lady, but she is so disorganized and unclear.

She also has great stories to tell of her childhood in the former Yugoslavia.  Very approachable as well and fair on her exams.  I was not surprised by any of the content.  Overall, one of the best political science professors I had at UNC.","What a worthless class.  It's pure history rather than politics.  Vachudova is a nice woman, but she teaches in generalizations and stereotypes, lecture is pointless, and the TAs do all the work in recitation.  Exams are vague and don't test knowledge, rather your understanding of what she wants you to say.

You always left the tests feeling good until you got your grade back.","Lectures can be dull and boring. There are only two tests and they are multiple choice. The class isn't hard if you show up to class and do the readings. The information is fairly straight forward. He's good at answering questions. Sometimes his lectures are 30 min long & sometimes they last 30 min. I would definitely take more classes with him","Stimson is very smart, easily accessible, refreshingly relaxed, and extraordinarily reasonable when it comes to scheduling & grading. The lectures are interesting, informative, and well organized. He posts all lecture notes online (even discourages in-class note taking). Course grade= average of 2 papers (5pgs each), not difficult w/ notes+texts.","Stimson very helpful, as are the notes he posts online after the lectures.

The blackboard site is very helpful.  Tests are multiple choice and not hard, but they're very short, so not much room to screw up.  The final's not cumulative.  Unfortunately, recitation is like a completely different class with a lot of boring reading and a few papers.","Stimson is a respected political scientist who adds goofy humor to his lecture.  Take his class for an easy, yet worthwhile course.","The notes are online.  Attending lecture is useless.  TAs tended to be pompous and overbearing.
