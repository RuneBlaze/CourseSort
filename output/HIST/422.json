His lectures consist of relevant course material connected with current events, wit and humor that make for both an entertaining and informative lecture. You honestly won't want to miss it, he is so well spoken and passionate about his field. The class is difficult, but well worth the work.","Professor is clearly a genius and very passionate about the subject.  However, Naiden is a very disorganized lecturer and you never know what he is important and what isn't. Tons of reading, at least 30 pgs of textbook per class. The 2 midterms and a final plus six essay assignments, which are hard because of his bad lecturing skills.","This class was SO hard! He rambles on about nothing to do with the readings or the slides on the power point- he doesn't even know how to work it properly. None of the hw content is discussed in class, it is so confusing and jambled. Tests are hard and the TAs grade the papers very harshly.  Struggled to pass this but got all  As in other classes.","He gives good lectures but is not the teacher to go to for office hours and even told me to drop the class when I became concerned about it","Professor Naiden is a scholar of high quality. If you want to learn ancient Greek history at Carolina, this is the person who knows more about than anyone else here. If you want to be babied DON'T take this class, but if you are driven and really want to learn the topic, this is the class for you. Would not recommend to non classics/history majors.","As said, Dr. Naiden is a top notch scholar with a seemingly photographic memory for Greek history. However, his lectures are the least organized and most confusing/ineffective I have ever experienced in 4 years of college. Expect to teach yourself everything, read book like the bible, and hope your TA can clarify the mush that will be your brain.","Naiden clearly knows his stuff. He is the eccentric genius type and it's evident that he's very passionate about what he's teaching. However, he has a tendency to plunge into a topic that is hard to follow. His powerpoints do not match what he's saying. If you read the book and pay attention in recitation, you should be fine.","He is a very geeky guy, but you can tell he loves what he's teaching. He's always willing to help if you have questions or need something clarified. He's very clear in what he will test on and what he's looking for.","Very strange mannerisms, and his lecture style was a bit... abrupt (?) and yet also kinda boring at the same time. Exams were your standard blue book essays, and some of the prompts for longer papers were a bit weird... Not a horrible class though.","Covers nothing of significance in class but requires attendance anyway. He is not very approachable, and was rude when I tried to speak with him.The midterms were not difficult in nature, but because he doesn't provide any study guide and they require a lot of detail they can be difficult to study for. The Final sucks.","Kind of strange character. Passionate but geeky."],"courses":["HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST225","HIST106","HIST225","HIST392"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
