Best class I've taken at UNC. She is so helpful and takes the time to talk to you about anything you need help with. There's a lot of reading but it's SO interesting and class revolves around cool discussions on these readings. Coming from someone with zero background or interest in philosophy, this class is awesome."],"courses":["RELI325"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
