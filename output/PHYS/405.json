Once you figure out what he expects the class is rewarding. I'm no physics major- so I learned a lot and found it really interesting. A good teacher, even with sometimes difficult subject matter.","Seems nice on the outside but after attending all review sessions during the semester he wouldnt cut me a break on the final grade over a difference on less than 1%...never curved exams either...grading structure on exams very questionable...HORRIBLE LAST IMPRESSION","I nearly failed his class due to some personal trauma but Superfine did everything he could to help me get credit for his course.  He is a great guy and his class is as fun as any other on campus.","A really cool, down to earth teacher but his blackboard stuff is a pain in the ass!","Prof. Superfine is awesome.\r He is funny....and makes learning fun and easy","He was a fabulous teacher. Was lively and animateed every class. GO TO OFFICE HOURS! They are SO helpful! I would highly recommend this course to everyone.","makes classes fun and interesting. definitely go to his office hours, very helpful.","Excellent teacher, not too hard, especially if you know what hes looking for. Easily the best class and teacher I have had here.","pain in the ass with his grading","Definitely an interesting class, but it is extremely hard.  Lots of homework assignments and difficult tests.  He's very personable and makes class interesting and enjoyable with demos.","He's really animated and funny!  His class is never boring and he obviously cares very much about his students.  He makes you as interested in physics as he is.  Definitely a good class to take, especially if you've never like physics before."],"courses":["PHYS016","PHYS016","PHYS16","PHYS16","PHYS16","PHYS16","PHYS16","PHYS16","PHYSICS16","PHYS16","PHYS18"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
