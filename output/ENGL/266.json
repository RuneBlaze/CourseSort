However, three main papers make up 40% of your grade, so don't mess them up.","I had Professor O'Shaughnessy for 105i Natural Science and she is really nice. She did a good job of covering a lot of important categories of scientific writing (lab report, literature review, poster presentation, policy report, etc) and gave us a rubric for all the papers. Be prepared to do a lot of writing and make sure to revise papers","She's very nice. Took her for ENGL 105i for the Natural Sciences. Weekly reflections and responses to other students reflections that were two pages long. Keep up with assignments and you'll do fine. It is not an easy A, but it's not a difficult class. In class we didn't really learn anything. You learned more from sakai resources she posted.","Grading is pretty fair as long as time management is exercised. Be sure to revise papers (if you make the correct revisions, you'll do well on the major papers). Not a super easy A, but definitely doable.","She doesn't really teach you anything in class, you just kind of go to class to ask any questions about your assignments and she'll just post resources on Sakai. Grading is pretty clear. If you put in a good amount of effort you should be fine. Assignments were interesting since we got to choose our topics. Wasn't a super tough class.","Pretty good teacher.  Makes it clear what she expects of you, although the inclass assignments can be a bit ambiguous.  Just keep on top of your science writings and not wait until last minute to do your assignments and you'll do well.","The class was easy, but with the seven textbooks as well as online readings and weekly response writings, it keeps you busy.  She is kind but at times I felt like I was back in high school.  Boring class.  Also your grade largely depends on luck of the draw - your final presentation is with a group, and if one person does badly, everyone does.","This class is so easy if you just go to class and do the readings. She treats you as if your a high school student by retelling you what happened in the reading, so if you didn't do the reading, go to class. You can BS your ways through her essay and if you show her that your trying by asking questions, she'll give you an A. Do well on your papers!","This teacher has her favorite students and those are the ones with A's.  Everyone else gets what she thinks you deserve.  The class is super boring and the group work is so high school.  Also be prepared to read a lot of stupid novels written by dead people.","There is a lot of &quot;busy work&quot; in this class.  But, we got to go on field trips!  It's an easy class overall, but at times things can be stressful.  Also, be prepared to do group work.","No Comments","be prepared to work hard for your grade, i got an A- (that B- post was not true)","If  u can feel she doesn't like you, drop; HIGHEST u can get is a B-"],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGLISH105I","105I","ENGL105I","ENGL129","ENGL129","ENGL12","ENGL12","ENG23","ENGL26","ENGLISH12"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
