She assigns so many readings about 100 pages long for a two day period. The lectures are chock full of information and you need to show up to each and every one. She has no clear grading criteria on her exams (in which you'll only have two). Pay attention and try your best.","After you've acclimated to the weekly readings, you will be fine. The lectures are average, a lot of information to learn. Tests are not hard, but you have to remember important characters name, and not their actions/contributions.","Dr. Regester is willing to help you out as much as she can. She's incredibly knowledgeable about her craft but she doesn't dismiss your ideas and has no chip on her shoulder. And she's funny as hell.","She's very passionate. Pay attention to lectures because most of the test material comes directly from her mouth. If she can tell that you are trying then you will do well.","You cannot graduate from Carolina without taking one of her classes! Although the workload seems too much at first, the class is what you make of it and she will put forth just as much (if not more) effort into your education. She is very passionate about her work and it will rub off on you!","Great teacher! Though she comes off as a harda** to a certain extent, she's extremely helpful and informative. Did I mention she's hilarious&#63; The class is slightly challenging ) but if you attend class and take notes it'll be a breeze. Her film class was probably one of my fav classes at UNC. Highly recommend her Black film course!! Enjoy","Professor Regester was a good teacher who explained the materials clearly. Expect to take notes the whole class while she lectures, it'd be helpful if you bring your laptop to class, sometimes she does talk too fast. The tests are a little challenging because some of the identifications are very obscure, but if you study, you'll be fine.","IF you are an athlete or male--beware of Ms. Regester, she has a chip on her shoulder.","Dr. Regester is a great teacher. She is extremely knowledgeable and her classes are always interesting. If you really want to learn something and want to be challenged, I'd recommend taking one of her classes.","Loved the class!  Can't wait to take her film class.  Great person.  Easy to talk to but firm and straight forward.","Dr. Regester is amazing!  She is extremely well informed, her class is challenging and interesting, and she is a lot of fun.  This was on of the best classes I've taken."],"courses":["AAAD130","AAAD130","AAAD51","AAAD250","AFAM276","AFAM276","AFAM40","AFAM40","AFAM76","AFAM40","AFAM"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"AAAD","catalog_nbr":130,"section":1,"class_nbr":13025,"title":"INTRO AFRI AMER & DIASPORA STDLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"Fred Brooks Hall atRoom","room":"TuTh","days":"11","time":null,"instructor":"CALDWELL,KIA L","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["HS"],"enrl_cap":60,"enrl_tot":60,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=768527","fname":"Kia","lname":"Caldwell","quality":"3.3","easiness":"1.8","help":"1.8","clarity":"1.8","topTag":"EXTRA CREDIT (1)","grade":"1.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY"],"comments":["Her class could be much more in depth and interesting, but she instead chooses to print off wikipedia articles and read them as a \"lecture\". She is extremely arrogant, and states many disputed arguments as fact. Her tests are barely relevant to the class, and full of true false that are meant to trick you on 4th grade material.","Boring. Monotonous. She reads off the book 90% of the time. Gives terrible feedback to students' answers. She made me fall asleep twice and this had never happened to me in uni. Show up to class. Do the reading (if you want). Make a few comments here and there & you'll be fine. The material was great, but I don't know why she's still teaching here.","Go to class, participate and everything will work out nicely.  Easy A.  Very boring lecturer though.","I think Prof. Caldwell is a horrible teacher.  Her class is extremely easy but that is beside the point.  She begins every sentence with &quot;When we think about...&quot;.  She does a horrible job acknowledging student responses, and reads off paper during the class.  She doesn't know her stuff.  If you want to learn a lot, just read the textbook.","lots of papers to write; go to class, participate in class dicussions, .......you get the idea! all will be well. great professor........i would take her class again.","In class discussions are pointless.  No need to read any books.  As long as you can write a good paper, you will do just fine in this class.  You only need to read when you are writing a paper, so you can use a few quotes.  Attendance is mandatory, and shes not bad to look at ;-) so y wouldnt you wanna go&#63; Just go and stare, b/c u dont have to list","No Comments","THIS CLASS WASNT HARD AT ALL. SHE IS PRETTY SLACK, IT SEEMED LIKE AS LONG AS YOU WERE THERE TOOK ATTENDANCE AND HAD DISCUSSIONS AND THAT WAS IT.  ALSO ACCEPTS WORK LATE-- THOUGH SHE SAYS IN THE SYLLABUS THAT SHE DOESNT. ALOT OF ONLINE READING TAKE HOME FINAL."],"courses":["AAAD130","AAAD130","AFAM101","AFAM101","AFAM66","AFAM266","WMST266","AFAMWMST66"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"AAAD","catalog_nbr":130,"section":990,"class_nbr":11937,"title":"INTRO AFRI AMER & DIASPORA STDLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["HS"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":6,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
