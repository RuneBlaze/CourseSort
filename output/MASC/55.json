One of his main goals for the class was to get us involved in research.  The class involved reading  articles and writing short one-page summaries of them.  They were pretty easy as long as some effort was put into them.  I fully recommend his class.","A very knowledgable man who sometimes commented on scientific topics without complete explanation. Weekly article readings and one page, double spaced EASY write-ups directly from the article are assigned. However, his grading system is a bit unclear because I turned in all assignments and participated in class discussions but got a B+","I took Dr. Martens in the freshman seminar program.  The class was an excellent learning experience.  Laid back atmosphere and small class size also allowed me to meet a lot of people.  Dr. Martens is definitely one of the best teachers at UNC."],"courses":["MASC055","MASC006D","MASC006D"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
