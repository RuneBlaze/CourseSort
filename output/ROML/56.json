Also if it matters, the class was mostly discussion based and there were few assignments.","Rao is a great professor. Kind. The only thing I was disappointed in was that he did not attempt to learn names. I think if that is the biggest concern, then there is really nothing to worry about though. Don't take advantage of him and skip class, though, because it will definitely negatively impact your grade. I got an A, but I never missed class","All of the other comments are accurate to a tee! Ennio Rao is the nicest most grandfatherly professor you'll ever have. This class is almost a guaranteed 'A.' However, stimulating, it was not...it was a pleasant class, but if you're looking to be intellectually challenged at your wits...look elsewhere.","Rao is enthusiastic, smart, and grandfatherly. His class is laid back, but he does a great job explaining the material. I highly recommend  this course, but do not take advantage of how laid back he is. Go to class, he takes attendance about half the time, and he will notice if you never go.There is strong emphasis on the final presentation.","Dr. Rao is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.  I would highly recommend his class.  It is in depth enough for those who are passionate about the subject, and accessible enough for those who aren't.  He has a very pleasant demeanor and is very amicable.  I would take the class again in a heartbeat.","He was such a great professor!  Extremely friendly and funny, such a sweetheart.  If you can get a first year seminar with him- DO IT!! His class was definitely one of my favorites, we read amazing books and had easy-going  intellectual conversations.  By the end of the semester you will definitely feel as if he was your little Italian grandfather.","Integrates Italian and English in a way that helps you learn.  Amazing knowledge of other languages, etymology, and mythology to boot!"],"courses":["ROML056","ROML056","ROML056","ROML056","ROML056","ROML056","ITAL14"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
