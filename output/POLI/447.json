His lectures are thorough and pretty interesting. He is an intellectual, and will make sure you know it. You take notes without stopping throughout lectures. Tests are completely essay/short answer. Three tests and participation is pretty much your grade. BUT, I definitely learned A LOT in this class!","Professor Maxwell is a good lecturer. He made going to class fairly interesting, despite some of the less interesting class material. But thats about all he does for the class. The TA's are in charge of everything else. Grades are determined by a few tests and recitation participation.","All memorization, tests are the same format every time and all free response. The concepts are fairly common sense. If you study you will succeed.","He's a very smart professor who knows his stuff. If you're interested in the topic it's worth it. Be prepared to take a ton of notes during class and read a good amount outside of class to do well. I found it difficult, but I don't regret learning from him.","You really get as much out of his class as you put into it. He is a very clear lecturer and is very clear about what he expects of you. Nonstop note taking in his class, but his lectures are very organized which makes it easier. Tests are all essay/short answer based, which is good if multiple choice isn't your thing.","DON'T DO IT. He is ridiculously smart and you will fail miserably. He is so intense and assigns a boatload of reading for every class. On top of that, you have to write a very long paper. You think he's throwing you a bone when participation is a large part of the grade but it's very difficult to participate because you have SO many readings to do!"],"courses":["POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI433"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
