He listened carefully to feedback after each exam, incorporating the feedback into how he ran the class (almost personalizing it). His lectures are long and not very interesting, but you don't necessarily have to go to class to pass. Overall great guy.","Karl is very competent. He is extremely clear, creates all the notes you will need in powerpoints, and gives you study guides. I found this class *very* easy. That being said, averages on the tests were around a 2.5-2.6 gpa (?), even after he bumps them up by 6-10%. If you're competent, you should do really well. It is an interesting course.","The best professor I have had. I took his Marine Science class first semester of my freshmen year and he made the class so amazing I declared a minor and hope to take all classes with him! He is the most caring and understanding professor there is. He always makes sure you are on the right track and tries to get to know you. Awesome professor","MASC101 and GEOL103 are the same course - Karl is not just an awesome professor, he's an awesome person. exams are easy if you follow the notes. he gives a comprehensive study guide before each exam. really understanding and willing to help anyone!","Great Professor.  Very Enthusiastic!!!","Great Professor.  Very Enthusiastic.","He is from Belize and is difficult to understand. He also didn't wear a mic in a large lecture hall, very hard to hear! When going through power points he doesn't give you time to write down all the notes!"],"courses":["MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","MASC101","GEOL103","MSC01","GEOL103"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}},{"subject":"ENEC","catalog_nbr":891,"section":45,"class_nbr":11696,"title":"SPECIAL TOPICS IN ECOLOGY","component":"Lecture","units":2,"bldg":"Wilson","room":"0107","days":"MWF","time":"10","instructor":"WEAKLEY,ALAN S","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":2,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1106325","fname":"Alan","lname":"Weakley","quality":"4.2","easiness":"3.2","help":"3.2","clarity":"3.2","topTag":"Tough Grader (1)","grade":"3.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY"],"comments":["Easily the most boring class I have ever taken at this university. Could not pay attention in lectures, no matter how hard I tried, and the book and powerpoints are useless, making it impossible to study for the exams. Other stuff is easier, however, and I got a B while doing literally no work whatsoever.","Weakley is definitely knowledgeable and willing to help you out if you are struggling, but don't take this class expecting an easy A. There is a lot of memorization involved. If you put in the time though, you should get a good grade!","Very memorization heavy class. People tend to really like Weakley or really dislike. I liked him! He's a cool guy and lectures are pretty interesting. Not too much problem solving in a class like Local Flora, but tons of flashcards.","I LOVED this class, by far my favorite biology professor at UNC. He is so nice and really wants to get to know his students. He's also always willing to help. It's a lot of memorizing sometimes, but his tests aren't like those other bio classes that applies confusing concepts to some really hard problem. A class worth taking!","Best professor I have had at UNC. Extremely helpful, friendly, and intelligent man. Dr. Weakley is an amazing professor and his class is so much fun. He realizes that students don't care about their classes, so the class is entirely structured around how much each student puts into it. If you don't study, you won't do well, simple as that."],"courses":["BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272","BIOL272"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
