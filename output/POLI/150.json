Oatley makes the class pretty interactive and that helps a lot. I'm not a poli major so I struggled at times but overall it was definitely really interesting.","Wonderful teacher. Personally, I felt I struggled with the first exam, and he was extremely willing to help. Very nice, readings aren't too bad, and he occasionally cracks jokes. Lectures do get boring at times, but it's Intl politics, what do you expect?","Professor Oatley is incredible. He's very well spoken and explains difficult concepts super well. I would definitely take another class with him.","Professor Oatley makes this course enjoyable. He teaches in a thought provoking manner and exposes all sides of a situation and links case studies to themes and reoccurring phenomenon. Beyond that he is a very personable and helpful person. He also has the coolest shoes.","First thing: he's a gorgeous, Anderson Cooper-esque silver fox.  He's also very knowledgeable about IR.  I didn't like the class because I didn't find it all that interesting, but if you're interested in the subject then he's great!  He's very funny and also keeps you engaged in the lectures. Warning: uses game theory ALL THE TIME.","I LOVE Dr. Oatley! The class was a bit dry, but he's the best professor I've had in the Poli department. Brilliant, doesn't give opinions, caring, and level-headed. Really cares about his students. The class's worst aspect is the 3 TA-graded papers. Midterm was a piece of cake. Get to know Oatley... he's a fascinating and kind human being!","One of my favorite professors I've had! He can be a little boring sometimes, but the material keeps me interested. Super-duper nice guy! Very fair and clear expectations when it comes to exams and papers.","Great professor, if you have any questions  be sure to go to his office hours, as he is extremely able and willing to help. He is very knowledgable and the class should be interesting for anyone interested in Economics/International Politics.","Toatley is my hero. The class can get a little boring and difficult at times, but he's so helpful, and all the TAs seemed okay. He's very friendly and will be happy to clear things up if you need help. Seriously, take his class.","Professor Oatley is wonderful and is not one of the stereotypically stuck-up professors you run into sometime. He encourages the most participation in his class of over 250 people of any I have taken at Carolina. Lot of reading that is often scholarly but still a fairly good class. I was not interested in the topic very much but he made it better.","Best class I've taken at Carolina. He was an engaging teacher and really knows his stuff. I wish he taught more undergrad courses because I would definitely take a class from him again. There is a lot of reading but it's usually very interesting. Go to office hours at least once or twice.","He just follows his powerpoints- what elaboration he does add is really wordy and typically doesn't make sense.","I loved this class and the professor even more. His lectures, though sometimes boring, are well planned so you can easily follow the subject matter. Your grade is based on 3 kinda tricky multiple choice tests, but if you read the posted articles (that are actually interesting most of the time) and discuss in recitation, a B+/A- is easy to obtain.","Really enjoyed this class because I really enjoyed the subject matter. He posts all the notes from class online. I thought most of the readings were interesting. You have to understand the readings to do well on the tests. I would definitely recommend his class.","Professor Oatley is super nice, but his class is totally unenjoyable. The lectures are terribly boring and there is A LOT of reading. Unless you have time to read 50-100 pages of scholarly material each week, don't take this class.","Whatever you do, don't take Poli 58.  The course was a disaster and I don't think any of us learned anything (except research methods- those were useful).  Dr. Oatley is very nice, intelligent, and helpful, but his subject will bore you to tears.  There were several times when I contemplated throwing the Sanders book into a fireplace.","Great teacher! He loves what he does and is willing to do anything for a student who reaches out for help. Not great subject matter in this class, but I would love to take a different class with him","A truly magnificent professor. I would recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in international relations. Also, he literally wrote the book on political economy. Go to lecture and recitation and it's an easy B+, but an A is also attainable.","Oatley is a great professor - he's very fair, accommodating, and is an expert on the subject matter.  I found his class intriguing, and I really wanted to learn the material.  Go to his office hours, although he is a little awkward, talking to him one-on-one can help clear up any questions you may have. I recommend this class.","Oatley is a really nice guy, and the class was interesting.  He's not a great lecturer do to the fact that he's kind of awkward and sounds permanently congested, but he definitely knows his stuff.  I'd recommend this class to a friend."],"courses":["POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150H","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150","POLI58","POLI058","POLI150","POLI150","POLI150"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":150,"section":990,"class_nbr":11859,"title":"INTERN REL WRLD POL","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":17,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
