Aside from that, it was an easy class. He does not push his view on you. We only had one book that was required for class.","Lambert is a great professor I really enjoyed having him. Gives ID's for all tests, he's really not there to make your life hard. Just go to class and even remotely pay attention and you'll be fine!","His class is super easy, don't need to go to lecture to pass. However, it can be pretty easy to fall behind and not make this the easy A it should be. TAs do all the grading which could hurt you depending on who you have. Did a great job of not pushing his views on you.","Take this class because he said \"I consider my job well done when most everyone makes an A/A-.\" If you actually like learning about religion, he is great! He doesn't push his views onto you and is open to hearing about different interpretations. I like him so much for this reason, and I am excited to take another class from him next semester!","this is the most boring class I have ever taken, but I would take it a million times over because it is so easy. Lambert is a really good guy and wants his students to learn, and he has good TAs. Take it.","This class was by far one of the easiest that I have taken at UNC. The material is very straightforward and as long as you study the term list for the exams you will do well. The lectures are semi-interesting, and attendance is not mandatory. The only homework was one paragraph journals before each class that took maybe 15 minutes to write.","Dr. Lambert is very nice and he makes himself very available to help students, usually his TA's are pretty helpful. My TA Luke Drake is awesome! The classwork is fairly easy and so is the grading system. Religion is a sort of a touchy subject but Dr. Lambert does a great job of not pushing any certain belief.","Dr. Lambert is willing to help his students anyway possible. If you go to his office hours, he counts that as not only participation, but it's a great way to get feedback on your assignments. His lectures are rather boring, but he is a extremely nice. I would take another class with him, although I am not a religion major.","Lectures are boring. There is no point in going, aside from the fact that you have to turn in a short journal to count as your participation. Simple, and not difficult.","Professor Lambert is an awesome instructor! He responds to every question with attention and his assignments are insightful and flexible. I learned a lot from this course that I would never have on my own. I highly recommend this professor!","Love this guy! I assume he is much better in small classes, because getting to know him is key. EXTREMELY interesting and thought-provoking insights on the Bible, and as a Christian he made me think of things I never had before! He is extremely reasonable in assignments, he doesn't assign anything unnecessary. He understands students!","Gives you simple work, classes go over homework, gives comprehensive study guide before every test. Failing this class would take an act of YHWH.","I loved this class. It was really interesting material. Professor Lambert gives you way more information than you need for the test, and the tests are very easy. You don't have to buy the text though; any bible will work. Good, interesting GPA boost.","The information taught in this class was interesting, and the work load was fairly light. The exams were easy and representative of what was taught in class. It was difficult to pay attention during lectures, especially toward the end of semester. Sometimes his lectures seemed like rambling and it was hard to understand what he was talking about."],"courses":["RELI201","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI603","103","RELI390","RELI89","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
