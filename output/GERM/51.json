He is a true thinker, very witty, and his topics of discussion are engaging. Prof. Pike grades very fairly (the class was an easy A). The class is discussion-based, though verbal participation in discussion is by no means required. Prof. Pike respects opposing views.","Great guy, cool car, nice shoes, endless knowledge about Dictators and their Defenders. Always has sweet memorabilia to show the class. I would go to Vegas with this teacher, he is that cool. Great Class,would recommend to anyone.","One of the nicest and most intelligent professors. If you pay attention in the course, it is very interesting. A very fair grader. Expect a lot of emails  from him. He likes to ramble in the class as well as in emails. He does have a final now, but it's not too hard as long as you've read the most of the articles he sends and watch the videos.","I took his FYS and it was very interesting and easy. He knows A LOT and can talk about current events forever. I mostly did other homework in that class and he didn't seem to mind. There is only one midterm paper and one final paper which are easy. Just make sure that it is a paper written by a college student not a high school student...","I really enjoyed his class. But if you aren't interested to begin with, you aren't going to get anything out of it. It's very interesting if you actually do listen to what he says, but he does tend to ramble on forever. He's a fair grader and you wouldn't make less than a B in his class.","He talks talks talks and talks. you will never get anytihng belowe a B. if u try then u will definately get an A. I didnt do $h!t in that class and still got a B+","Rambles...but he's a nice guy and a fair grader","Awesome Guy...yeah sure he rambles but he's fair and he's funny.","oh my dear lord most boring class ive ever had in my entire life. tons of reading..but dont bother doin them b/c there's no tests..just 2 papers on whatever you feel like writing about. no final. if u want a super easy class that will bore you to death, sign on up","Borring...horribly borring...managed to spend an entire semester in his first year semininar without learning A SINGLE THING. Wish that I would have dropped...","One of the best professors I've ever had. Interesting, really intelligent guy. Makes interesting connections between past and present events. I loved this class, and I would definitely recommend taking one of his classes.","so boring... rambles... makes me want to stab myself in the forehead... every second of this class is an eternity of mind numbing pain"],"courses":["GERM059","GERM59","GERM51","GERM059","SLAV251","HNRS353","GERM059","GERM059","GERM059","GERM059","GERM059","GERM059"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
