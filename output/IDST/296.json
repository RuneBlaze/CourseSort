His class is less interactive than previous Spanish classes that I've taken and he likes to talk a lot. However, he emphasized things like accent, pronunciation, and ability to communicate with native speakers that I hadn't learned in other classes and that will help me.","Professor Maisch is a really great guy. He's willing to get to know his students, and it's worth getting to know him -- he's always willing to help you out in a pinch, and he was happy to write letters of recommendation for multiple students in my class. Beware that SPAN204 is tough, and you have to study to be prepared for class, but it's doable.","I learned a lot from Professor Maisch. He is a funnygoofy guy that's super passionate about Spanish.  However, he talks really fast, goes off on tangents easily, and isn't super clear.  If you don't have an affinity for languages or don't have the willingness to work hard, this class may not be for you. He loves the culture and it shows.","Honestly, I found this professor to be quite patronizing... Whenever a student asked for help or clarification in class, he would tut-tut them and make them feel stupid for asking. Not very conducive for a good learning environment or for active class participation, especially when people are afraid to talk in a foreign language already!","Don't get me wrong, he is a very nice guy and loves his job but as far as &quot;teaching&quot;  his class is more like self guided learning.  He will assign something you have never even seen in class and expect you to know how to do it.  Very difficult and challenging professor, very strict on grading.","Good professor, he was helpful and encouraging even to the worst student. I learned a great deal from his class, and his teaching style was effective. Overall good class, and not that hard","Very goofy guy, but energetic enough to keep you interested (even if it is way too early in the morning). Somewhat tough grader, but only because he has to be. I'd highly recommend him."],"courses":["SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN102","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN102","SPAN204"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"IDST","catalog_nbr":296,"section":5,"class_nbr":16480,"title":"COURSE CORRESPONDENTS","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"PRUVOST,VALERIE C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":999,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=544739","fname":"Valerie","lname":"Pruvost","quality":"3.7","easiness":"4.3","help":"4.3","clarity":"4.3","topTag":"Participation matters (4)","grade":"4.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SKIP CLASS?

She constantly has us participate and it really makes a difference in your ability to speak the language. Plus, she's a fun teacher who really connects with her students. She's sweet so just give it your best and you'll do just fine.","Amazing professor. Extremely engaging and helpful, best french professor i've had here. Tough grader because she's a native speaker, but nothing new with french professors at UNC. She definitely improved my french speaking and was extremely helpful and available to help outside of class. Take with Pruvost if you want to improve your french","Tough grader, yet again, I honestly didn't try much. Takes points off for things that are clearly typos. Nonetheless, great professor! I found her classes fun and my speaking and comprehension improved a lot. I do recommend if you want to accustom your hearing and comprehension to native French.","Dr. Pruvost is a native French speaker, so she knows what she is talking about. She is a hard grader (I've only gotten one 96 and then nothing higher than a 90). I think an A- is pretty doable. In my opinion she makes her classes fun and tries to encourage you to participate and get it wrong in class than on the exam. I reccomend her. :3","She is extremely fluent in English and obviously French (from Paris), but she is also very stuck up and thrives on correcting any mistake you make. Also her grading system makes no sense, because you get huge percentage points deducted for each little spelling mistake or grammar error. Typical Parisien snob and I don't think my French improved much","Really strict.","Dr. Pruvost is very enthusiastic and very nice. She does grade a little hard compared to other teachers (I normally get A-'s in other French courses but only got B+'s in hers), but I feel like my French improved. For 300 and 310, she does not assign very much outside work.","Dr. Pruvost's classes are highly entertaining but effective with reasonable amounts of homework. That being said, she an extremely demanding but excellent professor who will transform your French skills if you try in the class. If you're someone who likes to strive for perfection, then Dr. Pruvsot is one of the best professors at Carolina.","It all depends on what you want... Pruvost is an excellent teacher but a VERY tough grader.  My French skills got much better, but not a single person in our class got an A. If you're looking to improve a lot, I'd take it, but if you're worried about your GPA (I was), I reccommend one of the grad school teachers.","Very nice, and is very interactive in class but teaches as if everyone should have already mastered the skills that are being intorduced in this course.","Pruvost was the best French teacher I've ever had. With her, you get what you give. She is ALWAYS available for extra help. She is crystal clear in her explanations and is a master of French and English. She always responds to e-mails promptly and thoughtfully. Yes, she's though, but my French skills have sky-rocketed.  My whole class adored her.","The devil. She is rude and cold--typically French, just like the commenter below noted. Assigns ridiculous amounts of reading & work!; if you aren't better than her @ French (which you can't be) you'll get a C. She loves giving horrible grades & is a terrible teacher & person. She doesn't really even 'teach', just tries to make everyone feel dumb.","She's very knowledgeable and clearly wants students to know the material, but if the class average is a C does that say something about the students, or the professor&#63;","She's nice, but she's VERY difficult.","A  little too pretentious for my tastes. The typical French bee... if you ask me. Her classes are somewhat rewarding though.

She's funny (sometimes unintentionally so) and she's pretty relatable as a human being. Sometimes she's tough on grading, but if you have some kind of extenuating circumstance she will gladly work with you to figure things out.","I LOVE PROFE DE FAYS!! she is absolutely HILARIOUS and truly cares about you! i have had some attendance issues because of things going on outside of class, and she really is understanding and works to meet you halfway. she does give points for partipation everyday, so it is important to raise your hand. she is great if you truly want to learn span","Profesora de Fays is really funny and engaging in a small (20) class; she makes jokes and can tell when we're bored. She really wants participation and you get daily points for it. She was available for help and very forgiving if you attend class and engage. Importance of readings is inversely related to how well you understand her spoken Spanish.","I personally didn't like her. When we did presentations, I spoke fluently and with a pretty good accent (I've taken Spanish since 2nd grade) but I'd always get a B or a B+; yet, the girl with a pretty bad accent and constant pauses gets an A...","Excellent teacher. She is knowledgeable, approachable and reliable. She respects her students and encourages them. You have to work hard and cover a lot of material. She brings it all together with a sophisticated, cosmopolitan sensibility.","Super nice and approachable. The class can get boring at times, but she does her best to keep it interesting and keep students engaged. It's also pretty much a guaranteed A or B if you do the reading and study for the quizzes.","I took Spanish 101 last semester, and, while being very likeable, it seemed like she was impatient/uninterested with teaching us beginners new material. She covered subjects too fast and did not seem sympathetic to beginner problems. She was very funny and pleasant to be in class with, though, and i ended with a B+ in the class.","Very friendly and easy going person.  330 covered a little too much (ancient times through 1917), but was extremely interesting.","One word, boring. Had a big lecture class with her. Easy though.","She keeps the class interesting and definitely has a sense of humor.  Her class isn't the easiest but as long as you pay attention and ask questions, it turns out fine.  She is a great person in general!"],"courses":["SPAN331","SPAN204","SPAN331","SPAN204","SPAN330","SPAN330","SPAN101","SPAN330","SPAN330","SPAN203"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME"]}}]
