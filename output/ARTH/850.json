Still not quite sure what I have learned or was suppose to learn. Literally got our first grade on the very last day of class.","I was super excited about taking this class, but it was not what I had hoped it would be. I am still wondering what the real objective was. Lectures were somewhat boring. Professor Magee is professional and fair. I wish the class had a bit more spice and/or flair to it.","Yes, this class is hard. Yes, she grades hard. If you are looking for an easy road through college then avoid Magee. However, if you are interested in improving your critical thinking and writing skills while learning about something esoteric yet interesting, consider taking this class with Magee. It also satisfies a truckload of Gen Ed requirement","This class was the bane of my existence. Her lectures are extremely dry and hard to follow. She grades EXTREMELY hard. Classes are either lecture or group discussions. Group discussions include forced discussion about boring readings. SHOULD be an interesting class but IS NOT. DO NOT TAKE.","This class was crap. Barely related to art at all and she graded so hard it was next to impossible to get an A, even with extra credit. Lectures were super boring and she was really hateful too. Bottom line, if you take art stay away from Magee!!","I have taken two classes with her and she is amazing. A presentation and some response papers is pretty much all she grades on. Pretty easy material, some reading, but very interesting too. She is the nicest woman also! Very helpful and kind.","I have taken two classes with her and she is amazing.

Her lectures suck and she is heartless.","No Comments"],"courses":["ART353","ART353","ART353","ART353","ART155","ART488","ART488","ART290","ART61ART118"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
