Will never take another class with Jay again.","My favorite professor, and I've never enjoyed a history class before. Very friendly guy, very down to earth. His teaching style is based more on discussion and analysis than on memorization.","An egomaniac.  He knows his stuff when it comes to France.  However, he has been in an out of class public debate against his own employer.  I do not agree with his opinion but I especially do not respect him bringing this into class.  He hates sports and athletes. He loves to put down anyone who may disagree with him.","Horrible professor.  Spent most of his time talking about how much he hates basketball and football players at UNC rather than tales of the GÃ©vaudan, which I was most interested in.","I had little interest in 516 before taking it but Professor Smith made it more interesting. Class was very laid back and assignments were all about thought and effort. Even though the course material was extremely complex, Smith tried to create a relaxed discussion environment. Interesting class overall.","I LOVED Professor Smith's class.  Lectures and documents were interesting and I always enjoyed recitation discussions. Although I think that depends on your TA. Do not take Hist 151 for an easy A.  I think there might have been 6 As this semester out of 150 or so. But I worked hard and got an A so it's not impossible.","Really nice guy. His lectures can be a little boring and he talks quietly so it can be hard to hear him, but overall the material is interesting. TAs have a lot of control over grade so easiness depends on them; assignments aren't too bad though, take-home midterm essays, a relatively easy final, and some easy MC quizzes.","I have never been able to stay awake though an entire one of his classes. He seems nice and respectful and sincere, but he reminds me of the ghost that teaches history in Harry Potter.","Lecture is pretty boring and he puts all the notes online, so you can get away with not attending. The midterms were fairly difficult and required a lot of memorization, but in class quizzes were easy. Didn't do much of anything for the class and still pulled out a B.","He's very easy to listen to and he really does make class time go pretty quickly. There are 5 quizes, but the one with the lowest grade is dropped. There are also 2 approx. 4pg papers, and 2 exams with short anwser and IDs. I got away w/o doing most of the textbook readings, but you do need to read the primary sources.","Class is pretty interesting for the most part. Lots of note taking. Easy quizzes. The tests aren't bad if you study lecture notes and do the readings. Class time goes by fairly quickly.","No Comments","Excellent Teacher, Really knows his stuff, and is very animated- so hes easy to listen to.  Quizzes are easy, but the midterms are fairly difficult- you really need to know the details.  Overall- probably my favorite class this sememster and I hate history.","he's very interested in his topics but he can get distracted easily..he's funny too :-)"],"courses":["HIST84","HIST84","HIST456","HIST456","HIST516","HIST151","HIST151","HIST152","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HISTORY","HIST011","HIST11"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR","AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
