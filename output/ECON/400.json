The material in Econ 400 is kind of boring, but he will make the lectures entertaining by telling stories.  He also gives study guides for all of the material on the exams, and posts previous exams on Sakai so you have access to practice problems.","Very clear and concise in class, and charming in a dorky way. The homework from the textbook and the tests can be very different; its better if you use practice tests to prepare.","Dr. Lich is funny and engaging. I liked statistics more than expected mainly because of him. You can do well if you stay on top of homework and do the practice tests.","He's undoubtedly very knowledgeable with what he teaches. Given the topic isn't the most interesting for most people, he does his best to keep you engaged. Tests are straightforward if you take good notes and do practice exams. Overall, he's a very good professor. I would definitely take another Econ class with him, maybe just not 400.","He is a fairly boring lecturer, but he is really receptive to giving help if you go talk to him. He is a little too enthusiastic in class for teaching a really dull class, but he could use a few more real-world examples to spice it up. All in all, he has a tough subject to teach with regards to excitement.","I'm in 480 and loving it! Dr. Lich-Tyler gives amazing lectures. He makes everything about labor economics clear and interesting. Grading is based on the book and tests. He gives the quiz questions in advance and let's you bring a cheat sheet, so you just have to do the readings. No surprises on the tests either. Love the class!","Dr. Lich-Tyler is one of the best professors at UNC. You can tell he's passionate about statistics, he wants his students to be too. I recommend that you take his class.","Tests are ok if you do the homework. Class feels like forever but thats just math. He does his best with examples from real life. His sense of humor takes getting used to. There is one or two good wisecracks it day. Makes dry material bearable, fun to listen to him talk. No surprises with grades.","easy class, very straightforward. there are no tricks on his test, try and you shall succeed","Really enjoyed class this semester!","Awesome!","How does this site give him negative and average reviews from students who obviously liked his classes? It's true that 570 isn't easy, and it's true that you don't go into it with \"obsessed\" interest. It turned out to be the best class I took at Carolina and he's the one that you want to take it from.","I wasn't sure at the start of the semester if I wanted to take it with him. I heard a lot of mixed things. I'm glad that I went ahead and did. It's econometrics so you're either going to love it or hate it. It turned out to be one of the best classes I have taken but also the hardest.","Another great semester with SLT!","SLT is the best professor I've encountered thus far at UNC. Statistics isn't the most exciting subject, but SLT gives you everything you need to succeed. Go to lecture, befriend him (he writes great letters of rec), practice old exams, and pay attention to his Stata demonstrations. Overall AWESOME guy. Highly recommended.","He's the man. 400 is fun and attendance is not required. His study guides outline literally everything you need to know. I highly recommend.","Statistics was better than I thought it was going to be! I highly recommend him, one of the best profs I've had at UNC. I'm looking forward to taking 570 with him in the spring!","A+++++++++ teacher!!!","I found to reading the textbook and attend help session would be a key to do well in the class. Also to focus on old exams is extremly helpful.","Honestly one of the best classes I've had in college and I can't believe I'm saying that about a stats class! I went into class thinking it would be horrible and came out enjoying stats. Thanks to Lich-Tyler's way of making it relevant and fun!
