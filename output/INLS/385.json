He's approachable and keeps his lectures breezy and fun. This class revolves around group work, so expect to be doing a lot of that... But don't worry, he's an excellent facilitator. He's an amazing resource and a really engaging person.  I felt like I could turn to him for advice outside the scope of class."],"courses":["INLS385"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
