Makes class enjoyable. About the same amount of homework as 101102. However, more is expected from exams.","Awesome language professor. Gets technical with his explanations at times, but is clear, helpful, and attentive. Comes off as strict, but is actually kind of hilarious. If you take the class seriously and don't miss lectures, you'll do well.","Prof Reese is the ideal language teacher. His expectations are very clear and he is strict but fair. If you are serious about the class, you will get a lot out of it.","He is very passionate about the subject and committed to sharing that passion with the students. Although he occasionally gets distracted by minor details in the text, he is a great instructor and I thoroughly enjoyed the course.","No Comments"],"courses":["406","203","RUSS203","RUSS406","RUSS425","RUSS101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
