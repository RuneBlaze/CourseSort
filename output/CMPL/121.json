I have taken two of her comparative literature classes (Romancing the World and Don Quixote) and plan to take more if possible. There is a lot to read but her lectures are always so interesting and insightful.","One of my favorite professors so far at UNC. As long as you come to class and do the readings, you will pass. Some of the readings were boring, but others were great and interesting (about half and half). Professor Collins truly cares about each student and what they learn from her. I would take this again.","She is the sweetest teacher. Her tests are very hard/specific, but she grades papers fairly. Lots of reading per class, but I would definitely recommend her!","I was delighted to have my senior seminar with Dr. Collins. For starters, she is SUCH a sweet, ebullient lady. She chose interesting texts, kept class discussions lively, and was reasonable with expectations/feedback. Also super knowledgeable in Renaissance lit and Cervantes.  If I hadn't graduated I'd be in her classes all the time!","I enjoyed this class because I love literature but I have a friend in the class who does not and she thought it was miserably boring. Overall, very easy if you read the books and attend lecture every now and then.","I took CMPL 390 - Don Quixote with Prof Collins and LOVED it. Stay on top of the readings, attend class and participate occasionally and you'll make an A. The tests weren't difficult if you did the reading and paid attention. Prof Collins is incredibly intelligent and very helpful! Definitely take her class!","Collins' lectures are very boring, she reads them directly from a piece of paper and they tend to be pretty unnecessary. You don't have to attend lecture very often to get a good grade in the class.","Dr. Collins is sooooo nice and very helpful. She really knows the material very well, and she is encouraging to all students. I learned so much from her. My only comment is that it would be better if she taught classes all in Spanish instead of English.","Dr. Collins is the best professor! She is very helpful, kind and patient, and she really knows her stuff. She works with both Golden Age and Twentieth Century Spanish lit and is well-versed in both. Her classes are not easy, but they are worth taking, and if you work hard you will do well."],"courses":["CMPL121","CMPL275","CMPL122","CMPL500","CMPL121","CMPL390","CPML121","SPANGRAD","SPANGRAD"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
