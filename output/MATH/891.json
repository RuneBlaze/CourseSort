Material is tough but the bi-weekly homework is manageable, Final (50% of grade) is take-home w/ a bonus question. Final research group project (30% of grade) takes a bit of work but will boost your grade. Doesn't take attendance, but skipping class means missing material","His accent takes a bit of getting used to, and he tends to fly past materials if nobody stops him. He is very passionate about his subject and will not stop to clarify if nobody asks him to. The final is a take home test","Couldn't even understand what he was teaching, so I never really learned the material. However, he goes over what will be on each test exactly, and test/hw aren't too difficult. Get someone else though if you want to learn","Ivan is very hard to understand, but he is very friendly. he can be very helpful if you know how to ask the right questions. I have seen him give answers to exams during the exam time. he also makes it almost impossible to fail the course: many tries on h, 2 tries on exam questions, and the process for how to solve exam question before the exam.","Ivan is a very kind person, and he genuinely wants you to understand the material, but he won't force you to. I had Calc 3 (multi var), and the day before each exam, he showed you an example of each problem on the test as well as exactly how to find the answer. I haven't learned anything from him this year but will ace the final grade easily.","Ivan is a sweet Russian guy who loves Rabbits, History, Sweaters and Ivan's Game.  His endearing personality makes combinatorics a memorable class.","His accent is very thick and normally difficult to understand. He speaks through sayings and odd stories, which sometimes helps but sometimes just compounds the difficulty. I am good at math (scored an 800 on the math SAT), yet this class kicked my butt because I couldn't understand him and therefore couldn't understand the material.","Had him for FYS Combinatorics.  The class wasn't hard but his accent takes some getting used to.  He knows what he's talking about but sometimes it's hard for him to make you understand."],"courses":["MATH062H","MATH062H","MATH233","MATH233","MATH233","062H","MATH64H","MATH062"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
