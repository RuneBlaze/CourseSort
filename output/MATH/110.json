I'm really bad at math, but she was always there to help me when I needed it. I failed my first test, but she was really understanding and helpful and went over the test with me to go over my mistakes. She's a good teacher and her lectures are clear-cut.","Caroline is the best math teacher that I have ever had. She is more than willing to meet with you one-on-one and help you understand all material fully. All of the material is explained fully in class though so as long as you pay attention, it is relatively easy to understand. Take all notes in class and go to class and you will do well.","Came into this class as a student that struggled in math and this class was no different. She's a tough grader and wants things done in a specific way and will take off points. Class is mostly examples that don't really apply to the tests and the homework is a lot easier than the test questions. Final was different than review and weird wording.","The class is fairly easy but she is a VERY tough grader. She wants answers in a specific format and if you forget anything she will most likely mark points off."],"courses":["MATH110","MATH110","MATH110","MATH110"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":110,"section":2,"class_nbr":2034,"title":"ALGEBRA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0332","days":"MWF","time":"11","instructor":"MCCOMBS,MARK A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CTOPS"],"enrl_cap":62,"enrl_tot":60,"wait_cap":15,"wait_tot":14,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=78355","fname":"Mark","lname":"McCombs","quality":"4.6","easiness":"2.5","help":"2.5","clarity":"2.5","topTag":"Respected (5)","grade":"2.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["ACCESSIBLE OUTSIDE CLASS","TOUGH GRADER","RESPECTED","RESPECTED","HILARIOUS","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","RESPECTED","HILARIOUS","CARING","HILARIOUS","RESPECTED"],"comments":["Brilliant teacher; understands how to teach math; had him over the summer for calc 1, and he taught a lot of material well in a short period of time; keeps class interesting; actively works to improve his teaching method","Mark is a really nice guy and willing to help if you ask, but he cancels classes a lot and doesn't provide much time for hands-on work except prior to exams. Lectures do not help with hw. His teaching style just did not work with my learning style-had to hire a tutor and use math center to understand. Stay away unless you are good in math.","McCombs is a great guy, and it really comes across in his teachings. He's passionate about math, and that may sound like it would make for an uncomfortable class experience, but i was very happy with him in Discrete. Tests are pretty fair if you study the homeworks, which are easy 100s. He also curved our course grades up at least somewhat.","McCombs is great! This FYS was super fun and easy. Would definitely recommend.","McCombs is a great professor and a great guy. He was willing to help out if asked, and definitely cares about his students. His tests are very difficult, however. Be prepared to work hard, this course is far from a easy A.","McCombs is a great guy.  He is so funny and explained the material well.  Super nice and always there if you need extra help.  Bit of a slow grader, but not so much that it bothered me.  Definitely take him if you have the chance.","McCombs had a really rough semester, but he still found a way to be a great professor. He's a really nice guy and he loves his school. Homework is given weekly, but you complete it in recitation so it's an easy A.  Will bump up your grade if he can. Not super responsive with emails, but he really cares about his students' success.","McCombs is cool and relatable and is very thorough and clear in his lectures. His class is very easy and great for humanities majors (like myself).","Professor McCombs describes his course as \"for people who want to learn math and live to tell about it.\" If you want an easy math that makes sense in the concrete and is designed for humanities majors, I would strongly recommend this class.","Professor McCombs is very funny and likable. The material was pretty easy but be careful because he grades tests very strictly. You don't really even have to go to class since all the notes are posted online.","HE IS AMAZING! I had the absolute best time in Math 110. I would take any course taught by Mr. McCombs! If you struggled with math or simply don't enjoy it, I recommend taking a course with Mr. McCombs because he is truly helpful and committed to his students. If you do the assigned work, you will be absolutely fine.","GREAT PROFESSOR. FUNNY.  Webassign math homework was way harder than the test. Test  SUPER EASY. Lectures pretty easy to follow. He doesn't take participation but lectures are essential","Super easy A. Also fun!","Math sucks at UNC","Great Professor!","Great Teacher!","He is an easy teacher and a relatively interesting lecturer with few quizzes or tests.","He made class very easy and went slowly. Almost painfully so. However, his method of teaching made the class seem so easy. Definitely recommend.","Very easy class as long as you do the practice problems before every test. No tricks or overly difficult questions on tests.","Professor McCombs is funny and nice, but he misses class too much, leaving us to be taught by second-rate professors. He's so far missed 5 classes and that makes it difficult to really learn the material."],"courses":["MATH231","MATH110","MATH381","MATH058","MATH381","MATH381","MATH118","MATH118","MATH118","MATH118","MATH110","MATH110","58","MATH110","MATH381","MATH381","MATH058","MATH110","MATH118","MATH118"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"MATH","catalog_nbr":110,"section":951,"class_nbr":11809,"title":"ALGEBRA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Phillips","room":"0224","days":"MW","time":"18","instructor":"Duh,Andrej","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":25,"enrl_tot":11,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
