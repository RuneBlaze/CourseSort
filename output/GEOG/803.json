As a first-year seminar, most of class time is spent having discussions, where you are graded on your participation. Modern technology usually wasn't a main discussion, which disappointed me. Your final grade depends on three papers, which aren't too hard but also aren't very interesting."],"courses":["GEOG062"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE"]}}]
