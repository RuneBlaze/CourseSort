Her lectures are informative and very interactive and full of practice. She does grade kind of tough sometimes and hw is lengthy, but she is perf.","Great teacher, but yeah you will work your butt off, she doesn't go easy on anyone -- especially if you haven't had experience with Chinese.","Very enthusiastic and friendly. Makes a difficult language manageable. Such a great addition to the Chinese Department.","She is passionate about teaching and incredibly well-prepared for class. She certainly doesn't grade easily, but grades inline with the rest of the Chinese department. Her class is interactive and she expects you to preview your lessons. Her weakness is pronunciation, she won't correct you at all, so you should probably  get a language partner!","Ge Laoshi is great! I've had 101-203 with her so far and will be in her 204 class. She's a clear presenter and prepares you well for each test while making chinese interactive and interesting. Her pronunciation of Chinese and English is great.","I love her! Taking her next semester for 102, she's an excellent teacher and so nice!","Lini Ge was very sweet. She's willing to help when you ask. You use the textbook only for looking at vocab and a couple of speaking exercises. Its easiness all depends on you. You need to study because Chinese is a hard language to learn but she doesn't mind working with you. Definitely going to try and get her for Chin 102","Ge Laoshi is amazing.  She is so friendly, and I think she may be one of the best teachers in the department, despite her recent integration into the teaching field.  Everyday I'm enthused to go to class and ready to practice.
