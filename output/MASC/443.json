You'll have to do your work but that's pretty much the usual at UNC. If you don't do your work and don't come to class you won't do well. But if you do you'll be fine. Solid professor.","This class is definitely good to take if you are looking to expand your in-depth knowledge about genomics. The papers selected for reading were interesting, challenging, and pertinent to the topics listed in the syllabus. Be prepared to read but the professor also helps lead the discussion and was interactive and supportive of student comments.","Very nice guy but not a very good professor. The test are almost all multiple select with no partial credit, to say the least this testing format makes it very difficult to do well on even if you have mastered the material. Lectures can get a bit dry but usually the topics are somewhat interesting. If you take this class expect C, or at best a B."],"courses":["MASC101","MASC490","MASC101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
