Covers a lot of interesting subjects but lectures are long and hard to follow.  His grading is random.  Tests are extremely complex (having to connect about 5 unrelated key words and 2 pictures in an essay, along with other short essays)","If you go to office hours he is nice and his TA's were very helpful and available for papers. Class was just confusing, a lot of abstract concepts you had to connect to readings. The many guest speakers were interesting, but his lectures were painful. I ended up with a high grade after learning to BS my way through the essay tests without reading.","This class is interesting, but you have to be willing to think very far out, and play by Prof. Herman's rules. The Keywords are very important. His lectures have a lot of cool visual material, but sometimes it is hard to get cold keyword meanings out of them. I had to take VERY thorough notes. Do not take this class if you expect a cakewalk.","Be ready to memorize lots of insignificant definitions! Word for word! You will have to spew them back out on the tests, which basically consist of applying ridiculous keywords to images that have nothing to do with them. The material is interesting, but it really gets lost amidst the academic jargon.","Professor Herman obsesses over &quot;Key Words&quot; which are basically simple words (such as visibility) that he complicates excessively. His class is like listening to an audio recording of a dictionary of visual culture; he can be very pretentious, and his grading can be arbitrary. On the bright side, there are no papers, and you don't have read."],"courses":["AMST284","AMST211","AMST484","AMST483","AMST483"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE"]}},{"subject":"AMST","catalog_nbr":994,"section":3,"class_nbr":10807,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"FERRIS,MARCIE C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=810060","fname":"Marcie","lname":"Ferris","quality":"3.8","easiness":"2.4","help":"2.4","clarity":"2.4","topTag":"Participation matters (1)","grade":"2.4","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["Oh, Dr. Ferris, how I love thee. In my class, she stuck to lecturing and Socratic dialogue, with occasional quality guest speakers. Passionate, good grader, and wants to get to know you. Sticks to the syllabus, gives clear due dates and mainly written assessments, but attendance and reading are mandatory for a good grade. Do it, and you'll be fine.","Marcie Ferris, really wasn't that bad, however there is another professor teaching the class Bernie Herman, and two TAS, who I highly suggest you avoid. DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS.","Ferris was awesome in this class. However, her AMST 211 class had 4 other teachers with it and they were all terrible. I do not recommend this class because they are not fair at all. I would take another class with just Ferris though.","fabulous! my favorite professor EVER! took 3 classes with her as a Southern Studies major. Marcie is awesome. Take any class you can get with her. ps. She usually brings in food a few times during the semester....","SUCH a great teacher! One of the best at UNC! take any class you can with her!","last comments are accurate. fair grader, she definitely sees that you give effort and grades more so on that. tells EXACTLY what will be on the midterm and final. final was take home. not a hard class. if you don't read the books, go to class and you should be fine. it was fun...take it!","sort of a lot of reading (like a chapter or 2 due for every class), not many tests, just lots of projects due at the end of the semester.

Her lectures are a masterclass in teaching and she packs so much into class. She sings, makes you sing, plays the piano, and the class is super-interactive.. sometimes too much because she knows when you are not paying attention and WILL call you out. So pay attention! Just stay engaged and you will love her class.","Class is well structured and paced. Big help in this kind of class. She is not an approachable professor if you ask me (once told me to just look it up in the book, then she felt guilty and helped me in person a few minutes later). Just ask TAs for help. She nitpicks on grading given the subject matter but you get used to it. Not a terrible choice.","Professor Neal has a pretty consistent style of teaching through lectures and class engagement, but she can be pretty intimidating to speak to and likes to prove that she knows her stuff. I found a great interest in the class (far more than I thought I was going to) and really loved the material, but you do have to put in work to get a good grade.","Great teacher and very knowledgeable, but assumes music is all you do. As a non-major, this class took up far too much of my time.","I took this class online, and communication was not Neal's strength. She would take weeks to return my email, despite what the syllabus says. Did not give helpful feedback on the papers. She was also late to put up the final. For weekly discussion posts, I have gotten feedback on 1/16 posts. Do not take this class.","Jocelyn is very passionate about country music and is an expert in the field. However, she expects you to be just as passionate and knowledgable. I studied hard for the testsquizzes and still struggled. Some of the info she expects you to know is juts unreasonable.","Master of her field; Prof. Neal brings a lot of excitement to the class but expects everyone to be just as energetic about Country Music. The class has a lot of busy work and the exam is four parts.","Dr. Neal is an amazing professor. Music 333  Popular Music Analysis. This course was difficult and had a lot of reading. She treated us like graduate students  future musicologists so she definitely expected a lot from us and truly cared about our learning. She is an absolute genius and you will learn a lot from her if you work hard!","Dr. Neal is hands down the worst prof I've had at Carolina. She is not understanding when students are sick and she is quite cocky. Her lectures are haphazard at best and her quizzes are much harder than they need to be. I've studied more than I have for other classes for her quizzes and still never managed to get above an 85. AVOID THIS CLASS!!!!!","AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!! Jocelyn is boring, a pain to deal with, and grades inconsistently. The quizzes are impossible and I put in more work for this class than classes for my major to still get a bad grade. I would only recommend this for music majors.","Do not take this class unless you are a country music expert. Expectations and workload are ridiculous for a 100 level class. Prof Neal is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject BUT she makes the class suck because it is so hard.  Do not take if you want to get an A","DON'T TAKE MUSIC 144. Biggest regret. She takes this stuff way too seriously unless you are a music major, you will fail. She plays recordings and expects you to know the insturments being used. I hate this class with a passion.","Does not prepare you well for what she expects you to know. Unrealistic expectations. Very condescending and passive/aggressive. Expects her students to know all the intricacies of music like she does. That being said, she is very passionate about her subject, however pointless it may be.","Dr. Neal was awesome. She taught us so much in a short amount of time, and she is truly an expert in her field. I've never met a theory teacher so intelligent. Although she comes off a little scary at first, as she calls on random people, we all realized that she is really caring and just making sure that we are all getting a great education!","Dr. Neal is amazing!  Super clear lectures, and she knows more about the topic than just about anybody.  Class is actually interesting almost every day.  Tests aren't easy, but they are totally fair.  TAs are good, too.  And in office hours, Dr. Neal will explain almost anything and help you with your papers, too.  Awesome prof!","Seriously one of the best professors I've had at Carolina! She's very passionate about the subject matter and tries to make a music history class as active and interesting as possible. She has high standards but is always available and really nice. I loved having her!","I really loved this class.  It was work, but it wasn't hard.  Basically just a lot of memorizing dates.  There is only a little bit of writing, and in my opinion, they do not grade very difficultly.  I was told that an entire paragraph of my final paper was unnecessary and still ended up getting an A on the paper.","Please please do NOT think that this is a cake class! I made that mistake and it backfired on me. I am a Music minor and these tests KILLED me because you have to know so many dates. Other than that, she is a great professor...pretty much a genious in her field","Neal is a great teacher!  Class was the best preparation for the rest of my music degree ever.  Not the easiest grader, but definitely the best professor in the department.","Worst person ever.

Only 4 tests. You don't have to go to class if there is a google doc you can study from. Recitation has homework. My TA was a weird grader (100, 75, or 0 for homework). Cobb is super enthusiastic and the class is really interesting. Would take again. Easy A if you commit a bit","cobb seems very interested in the subject and is eager to help. however, i found the lectures boring and confusing most of the time.","Native Americans in the 20th Century and it was one of the best classes I have ever taken at UNC. it is important to go to class to learn what is important because his lectures can be dense. Very interesting class and it gave me a whole new perspective of native american histroy. TAKE HIS CLASS","Dr. Cobb seems like a really good guy, but he often lectures beyond the class's time frame. Guidelines for his assignments tend to be ambiguous, making it difficult to figure out how to truly maximize your grade. Certainly not a bad class by any means, but his AMST/HIST 235 class was outlined to be more difficult than it should have been.","Professor Cobb is a godsend! He is such a fantastic professor. His lectures are always clear and his tests are not super hard as long as you study for them. He does best in smaller class settings. He is so passionate about what he teaches and he really cares about his students as people. One of my best professors.","Dr. Cobb is by far one of the best professors I've ever had! His lectures are really interesting, and there only homework is a a short reading response due at recitation each week. He also gives out a study guide for the exam! It's a little tough to write a good essay in the 50 minutes you have for the exam though.","Awesome person and teacher. Makes lessons very interesting, but be ready to work. He really keeps in touch with whats going on in recitations with TA's. Very passionate about subject and make his students feel similiarly. However, his tests can be challenging. However he made his two TAs, majors in the subject take midterms, both failed. Yikes.","Even though the class was online, Dr. Cobb made it interesting and interactive through forum posts and video lectures. He replies to emails quickly and is helpful in his feedback, plus the course material is very interesting. Definitely recommend the course and the professor!","Dr. Cobb is definitely a nice professor and very motivated to teach. However, he grades EXTREMELY harsh. I actually went to him several times for him to check over my assignments, and he said they were fine. Then he gave me a 65-75 on them. Do NOT take Dr. Cobb. He doesn't help the way he should, and will never acknowledge your hard work.","Dr. Cobb is an excellent and motivated teacher. If you read the assigned materials and show up to class, you will do well.","What a DREAM BOAT & he sings SO WELL. Plus his class was awesome. I came in knowing very little about Native American history, and I left with a whole new perspective on Native American history (it's NOT like what they taught me in high school AT ALL). Very easy if you keep up with the reading. If you don't read then you're doomed. Best class @ UNC","I LOVED this class, too, and the professor!! Dr. Cobb is such a fantastic teacher. He is so passionate and enthusiastic about the subject. The study guides before exams were very helpful. I Strongly recommend the class to everyone!","Really passionate about his studies and willing to guide students in the right direction when pursuing assignments. Definitely cute, talks to class about his life experiences as a Native American studies professor and former musician. Doesn't like to give tests but likes to make you write \"response\" papers to books and such. Gentle grader.","I LOVED this class and professor! I've always been interested in Native Americans and this class made me decide to pursue the major. He provides study guides before every exam so you know exactly what's expected and is very enthusiastic about all material. I could not have asked for a better teacher. I recommend him/his class to everyone!","Dr. Cobb is great and the class was interesting and exams were straight-forward. He gives you everything you need to know to do well on exams and there is no cumulative final. Overall, the class was easy, but each TA graded differently so how well you do depends on how harsh your TA is. Definitely recommend this class!","Dr.Cobb is literally my most favorite teacher ever. He is so animated about what he does, its incredible. He actually made me decide to minor in American Indian Studies because of the passion he has for his job. I want to be just like him when I grow up! and if I could take the class again, I would. He's really helpful and its an easy class to pass","Professor Cobb is so awesome. One of my favorite professors at Carolina. He gives you &quot;all of the tools to succeed&quot; by giving study guides and if you do them, you'll do really well in the class.
