Jeff knows his stuff. You feel like you're not learning anything as you go through the class, but if you take a step back you realize you're actually learning a lot. Definitely not a typical classroom organization. He's a nice guy though, so I'd recommend.","I love this dude. Jeff is hilarious, a fair grader, and a fascinating guy in general. He's very honest and gives good examples, and I'd take any class taught by him.","The class is basically some unorganized homework assignments mixed with a policy brief you turn in 3 times and some impossible true/false tests. Should be simple, but is made too complicated. Jeff is nice though. Didn't get anything out of the class.","He really cares about his students and the material. This was a politics of immigration policy class. We held a simulation to write and pass an immigration reform bill, and it was so cool. Participate in class and you'll get a lot out of it.","Great professor","Great professor! A bit unorganized at times but chalk that up to it being his first few semesters teaching a relatively new class in the policy curriculum.  He is extremely interesting to talk to and really understands that his class is not the only class you are taking.  Tests are fair, attendance is not mandatory, and no pop quizzes.","Class is really unorganized and frustrating with late posting of assignments/readings and test Q's can be somewhat vague and can be interpreted many ways. However prof. Summerlin-Long is a really great guy and never hesitates to help and give good feedback. Bethany is an amazing TA as well. Also, the Policy Brief is worth more than the exam!","I feel like I didn't learn anything in this class. The topics covered in class and the exam questions were very vague and can be interpreted many different ways.","Jeff's a cool good prof. A bit unorganized--he says he'll put up an assignment at a certain time and then wait a week before actually putting him up, and never tells you when he put it up! He's a fun lecturer and doing reading is pretty unnecessary. Fairly easy too.
