Boy, did I learn about the New Testament in this class. This should not be a 100-level course. It was very tough and time consuming for an entry level class - but I learned a lot. Only take Reli 104 if you're seriously curious about it.","This class was one of my favorites thus far at UNC. Don't be fooled it does take A LOT of work and there are papers due each week; however, it was very interesting and I found that it really changed my personal views. The tests are really stressful (the midterm was 5 ID questions... there were over 200 words to study) but they are manageable.","Bart is extremely knowledgeable about his subject and seems to be passionate about teaching it. The course is definitely not easy. Reading and excessive note-taking is necessary. Tests are 150 word IDs on the midterm and IDs mixed with essays on the final. One of the hardest classes I've taken, but an A is possible if you study (a lot).","The comments for this professor are outdated. He is much more difficult than he used to be. Great lecturer, interesting, and very accredited in scholarship of the New Testament. However, his tests are much more than just memorizing terms. I would suggest for Reli majors, but not for people looking for an A in a gen. ed","The class was extremely interesting and entertaining, and the textbook easy to read, but the class required more work than it was worth. One 2-page paper each week, ~40-50 pages of reading each week, a group debate project, & a final exam (10 key term ID's and 2 essays). It's difficult to get an A even if you do all the reading and assignments.","Very interesting professor.  One of UNC's best lecturers and the class is extremely well organized.  The exams consisted of memorizing the key terms in the textbook but if you do that, you are set.  Definitely would recommend","The BEST professor I have ever had at UNC. His classes aren't the easiest, but they're so interesting. Lectures are focused and he makes funny anecdotes here and there. Definitely take a class of his, you won't regret it!","The tests were basically just memorizing all the terms from the text book.... It was an okay class but too much reading for someone who doesn't really care for the subject.","I loved this class.  It was really interesting and I enjoyed going to it.  Ehrman, however, does put his bias into the class and the content he teaches.  He's a great speaker and a nice guy though.  The TAs are awesome!!!  I would suggest this class for people who are comfortable with their religious beliefs.","No Comments","hard class...it's pretty easy to figure out what Bart believes, and chances are, he'll tell you at the end of the semester...exams are ridiculous...you have to basically memorize the entire glossary of your textbook for the final. fairly predictable...great teaching style...but if you choose to share your thoughts, chances are they will be shot dow","Dr. Ehrman was one of my absolute favorite professors in college.  He's entertaining, interesting, open to respectful discussion of different points of view, accessible, and really seems to enjoy teaching. I was not a religion major; I just took the class as an elective and it turned out to be my favorite class all semester.  Highly recommend.","An interesting class, probably the most controversial I've been in. Covers a lot of good material and is an interesting, animated lecturer. Note: this is a history class so don't take it if you don't want to be memorizing tons of information! Final and midterm are difficult, but not too bad if you think about what you need to study.","I LOVED this class.  While it was hard, Ehrman is super interesting and he holds office hours at Armadillo Grill!  He explains the material pretty well and he has a fascinating biography.","one of the best professors i had in college - i actually went to his classes and like it.  and if you take his class - definitely attend the last day that is not mandatory - you'll want to hear his actual opinion instead of just the facts","A life changer if you are lost about things, and engaging if you aren't.  Goes out of his ways to keep personal views private and to respect yours.  Atheists, Agnostics, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus, Muslims, and Evangelical Christians alike could appreciate this man.","Ehrman has been my fave professor, hands down. He has a sarcastic sense of humor that I love and he is engaging and interesting. This is a teacher who makes you actually enjoy going to class. But, as someone else said, if you don't like your religious views challenged at all, don't take this class.","Great instructor.  I thought he went out of his way to keep his personal views private, which i felt was important at a diverse, publicly funded school.  Entertaining, personable instructor.","I truly enjoyed this class with Ehrman.  I feel he is a great lecturer.  He knew the material quite well.  Although, note that he teaches a very liberal view of the Bible, which was quite fascinating even though I personally feel isn't always accurate.","Very difficult, and he teaches to disporve the Bible.  Still, he is an AWESOME lecturer.  Entertaing, funny."],"courses":["A","RELI104","RELI104","RELI104","RELI104","RELI104","RELI104","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI103","RELI22","RELI22","RELIGION22","RELIGION22","RELI022","RELI22","REL","RELI22","RELI022"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
