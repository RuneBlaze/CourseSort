Professor Garcia expects a LOT from his students. This course is not an easy course.","Professor Garcia is very a very nice person and really wants his students to understand the material.  However, he seems somewhat unsure of himself when he lectures, sometimes portraying things unclearly.  Recitation attendance is mandatory but it does help clear things up.  Overall, not a bad class!","He was really knowledgeable about the topic and tried to make it interesting, but the tests were difficult, unless you did all of the reading and memorized the music examples. The written blogs and paper could be easily made up on the spot without too much work, and receive a decent grade.","He's wonderfully enthusiastic & knowledgeable about the course content!!  He ties in overarching themes (eg: music's importance to cultural identity) throughout the entire course, which is helpful.  He is very nice & willing to talk after class about confusing topics. We also had a chance to play some instruments and dance to some Javanese music!!","This class is great! Garcia is really good at keeping the lecture interesting while still being informative. The tests/listening assignments are fairly easy if you follow the directions and review the lecture powerpoints. The textbook is unnecessary but helpful for review. Overall, Garcia makes the class enjoyable even if you're not good at music.","the tests are not as easy as ppl keep saying..this is not an easy elective..take it if only really interested in music...","Latin American Music- Professor Garcia is an amazing professor. He is very thoughtful and genuine and always helpful. It is very important to know everything about the sound clips he gives on blackboard, and the reading is minimal. He is a wonderful lecturer and the topics he chooses are very interesting.  I would highly recommend this class.","Great teacher.  Fun and not too hard, just read a little and listen a little.  Th main thing is to keep up and not miss things and you will be game for an A.  On the tests, don't make your descriptions to specific.  Because even though thay are probably right and strait from the book, they will still count them wrong.  Be general.","World Music....read the book, bring a laptop for class to work on other papers and get to know your TA.","he does say &quot;umm&quot; a lot and stumbles, but he seems passionate about music and that's cute. lectures are boring. he does show movies that are on the tests/quizes, so you might want to go to those. 10-12 pg paper on 3 performances. not that bad, but pain in the ass. will gibbons is easiest for recitation, doesn't give lots of work but can be clueless","Horrible lecturer, I had to stop going to class because I couldn't stand to listen to him say &quot;ummm&quot; all the time.  Read the book and you'll be fine.  I got an A in the class and only went to lecture like 3 times.  I would recommend taking the class because it counts as two credits (fine arts, cultural diversity) very very boring lectures though","Brilliant man! Maybe not the best classroom teacher, but excellent at working well with students one on one. The best person ever to do an independent study or honors project with!","The joy of Music 46, was the ability to not take notes and still get an A. The papers were easy and the tests were easy. All you have to do is read the book and you will be fine, lectures are somewhat necessary, but if you just go to recitation you will be fine also. Overall easy, but boring.","This guy acts as if he's scared to teach the class. He stumbles over his words sometimes. But he does go over what you need to learn for the tests, posts study guides online, and is pretty fair when it comes to giving you the better handle on your grades. If you turn in your homework, you're fine!","Lectures sometimes bogged down, but overall a good teacher, and a study sheet for the exam did help! But this class also was great for the essentials of music theory.","Gave us study sheets for 3 out of the 4 tests which made them verrry easy.","Lectures are extremely boring and pointless, (we watched a 50 min video of people walking in a circle).  Tests are not hard but they are very picky.  Class does fulfill cultural diversity and fine arts though."],"courses":["MUSC234","MUSC146","MUSC147","MUSC146","MUSC145","146","MUSC147","MUSC145","MUSC46","MUSC46","MUSC46","MUSC98HONORS","MUSC46","MUSC21","MUSC21","MUSC46","MUSC046"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"MUSC","catalog_nbr":994,"section":18,"class_nbr":5286,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"FIGUEROA,MICHAEL","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2096909","fname":"Michael","lname":"Figueroa","quality":"4.5","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Skip class?

The only thing is the class was only offered early in the mornings and sometimes it's hard to stay awake. His lectures can be a little dry but it's easy to get engaged when familiar music samples are played. Figueroa also doesn't grade tough at all and is really easy to talk to.
