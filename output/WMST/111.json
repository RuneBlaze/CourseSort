She is very self-righteous & actively shut me down when I tried to bring up trans health issues in a sexual health class. Reading materials were interesting but I would suggest reading them on your own time.","Karen is the best professor ever. Don't expect an easy class though; she makes you read, do assignments, and actually work for it. However, it's totally worth it. She cares about the material and teaches it very effectively. She keeps class interesting, and facilitates discussion really well. This is my favorite class I've taken at UNC.","She is AMAZING. One of the best professors I have had at UNC.","Karen is hilarious and very down to Earth. I love the lecture and the TAs are pretty awesome as well!","It's a relatively interesting class and it is obvious professor Booth has a passion for what she is teaching. The class has made me think a good deal. Exams are easy if you've been to class and look over the study guide. Not much outside work either. Recitation is hit or miss depending on the TA. I personally love mine with Kim.","One of the best professors at UNC.","OHMYGOSH, karen booth is by far the best teacher i have had at unc thus far. after taking her 388 class (which i highly recommend if you can manage to get into it), i decided to double major with wmst. she is phenomenal. literally, every class discussion blowed my mind and it was the one class i had this semester that i actually looked forward to a","She was an interesting teacher who really cared about Feminism and educating the students (majority of them taking this class as gen. ed.) about feminism.  Recitation felt a little monotonous at times. As long as you read the required readings and look at the study guide, it's a good class to attend.","Such an interesting lecturer. I was initially taking the class to fulfill a curriculum requirement, but found a passion for the subject.  She really opens your eyes to feminist ideas and shooting down the myths.  I'm taking a smaller class with her next semester as well because I enjoyed her so much.  Highly recommended!","Excellent Professor! Interesting concepts about sexuality!","I did not enjoy this class, though I do have a developed interest in the subject. Although I learned a lot, I found the class unnecessarily difficult and I dreaded class time.  I found class to be formal, serious, and monotonous.  It was not a good learning environment and diverse opinions were not encouraged.","This class turned me off of women's studies altogether. She was extremely biased, and it showed in her comments on student's papers. There were meaningless daily papers that only served as busy work. Her lectures were scattered and pointless. Her pop quizzes were impossible regardless of whether you did the reading.","Literally changed my life. What an amazing professor. She's always ready for discussion and always made time for me. There were times when I did not agree with things she said - b/c they didn't fit into my life - and she was always courteous. It was a phenomenal experience for me.","Her wmst 50 class was the most amazing class I've ever taken. She was an interesting lecturer and was truly interested in getting her students to know the material, even if they don't agree with some of her ideas. She does an excellent job of bringing in movie clips, etc to make lecture interactive.","The problem with Prof Booth's class is that she treats her lectures as a way to advance an agenda.  That wouldn't be as problematic, but instead of allowing students to search, explore, and discover the issues that face women, she forces her class to adopt her views on the subject of women and specifically genderism and discrimination (hostility, etc).  Because I, at the time, didn't buy into what she and the TA wanted, I was graded harshly compared to other classes.  A joke of a class - b/c of above probs.","No Comments","AWFUL.","Her teaching focused more on gay/lesbian, and anti-war activism than anything having to do with globalization. Her schedule was never clear, her assignments were inappropriate, and her grading was personal and not professional.","ignore the above bad rating, i got her confused with karen ruffle","I have never had a teacher grade my papers so harshly, even in English classes."],"courses":["WMST388","WMST388","WMST111","WMST101","WMST101","WMST101","WMST388","WMST101","WMST101","WMST410","WMST102","WMST102","IMPERIALISM","WMST150","WMST50","WMST95","INTL093","GLOBALIZATION","WMST","WMST50"],"courseRatings":["POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
