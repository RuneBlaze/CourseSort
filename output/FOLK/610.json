Every time he speaks, it sounds like a brilliantly crafted poem. He is very very approachable and kind and really just a great person overall. His class was pretty easy and intriguing and I would definitely recommend having him as a professor.","Glenn (he goes by Glenn) is a dream come true. He is excited, engaging, and very understanding. If I had it to do all over again, I would ask that he come back as my father. He is just so damn cool.
