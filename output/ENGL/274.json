Her lectures are always helpful, and attendance counts so go to class.  She always available through email and responds in timely manner. I learned so much in this class that i use everyday, especially when about resumes, interviews, and business etiquette.","Tough grader and very nit picky, but you learn a ton of stuff in regard to business writing. Most informative class I took my freshman year, but also the class that took the most work","She is very smart and knowledgeable, and I learned a lot about writing from this class. However, she is extremely picky when she grades to the point where it is neurotic. She is nice and a good teacher overall though.","Very friendly teacher.  She is one of the few teachers I know that provides true, quality feedback on papers and assignments.  She truly wants you to understand what you did wrong and how you should correct it. She is very clear with her expectations which is helpful.  She's pretty strict on her rules and is a tough but fair grader.","Prof. Irons is such a good professor! Conversation in the classroom was always well-guided by her and captivating in general!","Susan Irons was one of the worst professors I've ever had at UNC. I love literature, but she was so boring that I hated her class.  Tried to give everything unwarranted psychological analysis.  Never encouraged any useful discussions.  Was incredibly nitpicky about paper format.  There are MANY much better professors in the department.","She was an amazing teacher. You learn a lot of things in this class that are useful in the professional world (memos, letters, cover letters, resumes, research proposals, etc.) I would suggest taking this class even if you aren't interested in business. She is a tough grader but gives you a lot of help. She is incredibly friendly.","Gives an overwhelming amount of material with very little depth or meaningful analysis.  The majority of the writings are mundane, which makes reading them difficult or unenjoyable. Looks for particular responses rather than encouraging openness. Not bad, but not great.  Try J. Thrailkill.","Gives an overwhelming amount of material with very little depth or meaningful analysis.  The majority of the writings are mundane, which makes reading them difficult or unenjoyable. Looks for particular responses rather encouraging openness. Not bad, but not great.  Try J. Thrailkill.","She is a sweet lady. There is a colossal amount of reading (5 novels plus countless short stories).  Just skim the bad ones (most) and contribute to discussion. There is a 8-10 p. analytical paper worth 25% of your grade, final exam 25%, midterm 20%, biweekly 1-2 page text responses 20%, and attend/partic 10%. Too many texts, too little depth. 4/5.","a wicked woman, incredibly boring - she just went on and on. her readings were way too much. smile a lot, but it's like a dr. jekyl mr.hyde thing going on -- wish i had never taken this class!","Wonderful professor!! Obviously loves what she teaches and is really enthusiastic. She is so sweet and really knowledgeable about American lit. Would take her class again in a heartbeat.","I love Dr. Irons! She is so sweet and loves all her students. She gets so excited when she lectures on her favorite writers such as Emily Dickinson. The reading assignments are a bit ridiculous (some will take 5 + hours to get through), so you'll have to skip a few here and there. Over all though, you must read to do well on the midterm and final.","TAKE WHATEVER CLASS THIS WOMAN TEACHES!  she's wonderfully sweet, approachable, grades very fairly, is engaged, and truly gets to know her students (has all 40 names memorized in the first week).  adorable, wears little jackets with pearls to class every day, knows what she's talking about-is AWESOME!  :0)","Very kind and knowledgable, not too difficult but no pushover either.","I'm a rising junior now and I had her my first class ever at UNC. She is still the best teacher I have had here by far! She is EXTREMELY nice and helpful and is very passionate about what she teaches. I see her on campus now 2 years later and she still remembers my name. Overall a great class and an even better teacher. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","shes in teh english department now."],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL105I","ENGL150","ENGL344","ENGL102I","ENGL344","ENGL344","AMER344","ENGL343","ENGL343","ENGL343","ENGLISH28","ENG88","ENGLISH28","BUSI100"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":274,"section":1,"class_nbr":13461,"title":"APPROACHES TO DRAMA","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0222","days":"TuTh","time":"12","instructor":"LANGBAUER,LAURIE","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":24,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=432300","fname":"Laurie","lname":"Langbauer","quality":"3.7","easiness":"2.6","help":"2.6","clarity":"2.6","topTag":"Tough Grader (2)","grade":"2.6","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER","HILARIOUS","GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["I took Dr. Langbauer's 19th cent. Brit lit class hoping to better understanding some of the best literary works the English language has to offer. Dr. Langbauer's lectures are incredibly long and can be very confusing at times (she jumps around a lot). I think that she really tries, but the large lecture format of this class needs to be changed.","I've had three classes with Dr. Langbauer and loved every one of them. Her classes gave the freedom to engage in research and projects that I not only enjoyed, but yielded more than just an end of semester paper. She has taught me much and is the reason I was able to go on and publish one of my first essays.","So, I'm not done with the class yet and may end up getting a good grade, but wow. She's extremely knowledgeable and seems like a nice person--but that's not what makes a good teacher. Her midterms are preposterously hard. No matter how much you might study, it's all extremely specific, dumb things. I'm learning very little. Steer clear.","I adore this professor! Her lectures were entertaining and very informative. Her class was a very healthy balance of a straightforward, multiple choice midterm, a couple papers, and a short essay final. The only issue is that grading is up to the TAs, so your experience there could be good or bad.","Adorable, just adorable. She's a great professor - funny and engaging, she really makes an effort to entertain students while educating us. You *have* to do the reading to do well in the class, and the multiple choice midterms are tricky, but otherwise a great professor.","For Langbauer's class she leaves the grading to the TAs: not cool. Instead try to get into a class where the professor grades your work. It may be harder and your grade may not be as high, but you will gain more from the experience.","Dr. Langbauer is a mildly entertaining lecturer but she is prone moralizing and only presents her own reading of a work. She is very knowledgable but if you care about the subject this can get annoying. You MUST read all the books but they're some of the best books ever written. For an English class the writing is minimal and the grading is fair.","I hated this class -- Dr. Langbaur's multiple choice tests are demeaning and only care about straight facts. They are extremely poor indicators of whether or not you've actually learned. Her power point presentations over animated and all of her lectures are sporadic, incoherent, and feel like a waste of time. Not for the serious student.","Easy class if you're not a slacker student. Lectures are hard to follow sometimes but she makes really quirky powerpoints that provide entertainment. Def need to do all the reading to do well on her tests, which are all multiple choice and can be tricky sometimes. I've had her twice and have enjoyed both her classes.","Enthusiastic and happy teacher, with slightly tricky midterms but awesome reading material.  The powerpoints made me giggle.","No attendance policy.  I went to maybe two of the lectures and only to a few of the recitations the entire semester and somehow still managed to get a B in the class.  Two multiple-choice midterms (that are curved very generously), a paper, an open-book/note final, and a recitation/participation grade.  If you make any effort whatsoever you should","She was very nice, very well informed, a pretty good lecturer.  the only problem i had in this class was with her TAs.  Tests were a little difficult but there was a nice curve.","Childrens literature class was great. interesing power points.  nice lady, pretty easy multiple choice/ short essay exams (3).","the powerpoints are annoying, her witticisms leave something to be desired... but she is unpretentious, kind, sincere, and knowledgeable on her particular area of literary study, which is a pretty interesting one.","extremely knowledgable, energetic, compassionate, decidedly NOT pompous. a natural teacher and a genuinely nice person. oh, and the powerpoints are amusing (charmingly outdated) if you don't have a stick lodged in lodged in your hindquaters.","wow. she gives new meaning to the word pompous. rather than actually lecture on anything that mattered, she chose instead to do stupid power points with all the moving cartoon characters added in as she read from an essay about the subject."],"courses":["ENGL338","ENGL291","ENGL291","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENGL284","ENGL338","ENGL338","ENG43","ENGL38B","ENG43","ENGL43","ENGL43"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
