I had 3 courses with him and that experience changed my life and career path. He was very clear that he expected a great deal from the 12 of us on the trip. Some saw him as intrusive and pushy but he showed more interest in us than any other professor I've had.","I went to office hours and was personally insulted. Told me everything I was doing as a student was wrong, and continued even after I visually became upset. Also criticized my extracurricular activities. saying they wouldn't get me far unless my parents were rich. Very interesting material, but terrible professor.","Dr. Jordan is definitely a professor who has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the African diaspora, and I actually learned a lot. While there are quite a few readings, and he's quick to call out students who BS on assignments (guilty), you should not make less than a B in his class.  Hell, I made a 98 on the final if you need reassurance! lol","Not sure who the prev. 284 reviewer is talking about. Prof Jordan certainly isn't \"ignorant\" -- he has a lot of knowledge on the subject, and its a fun class. Granted, he doesn't tolerate dumb answers well - boo hoo, this is college, not little league. When I did the work, I got good grades from him. When I didn't, I didn't get good grades. FAIR!","I personally think that Prof. Jordan is a wonderful teacher. He forces you to think a lot, but I got a lot out of the course as a whole. Plus I was able to do well on all the major assignments just through class notes without actually having to do the reading.","This class was just awful. Dr. Jordan seems incompetent. At th very least he is disorganized, lacks passion, ignorant but also arrogant, and seems to be tired of teaching. Definitely, one of the worst professors I've had at UNC. Be prepared for constant changes to the syllabus or just stay away form this terrible professor.","Has a lot of his own ideas and to him, youre wrong if you contradict. For exams, you read articles and write essays about them. Once again, it's tricky because if your answers dont correspond to what he believes, you'll get a low grade. Got an A in the class. Hes cool if you get to know him.","This was my second class with this professor.  By far it was easier than my first.  As a student you have to get adjusted to his teaching style.  He can be challenging but if you put in the work and go to review sessions you'll be more than ready.  This class was my second 'A' with him as a teacher so I know its possible to do well in his class.","Professor Jordan is a great teacher.  His ultimate goal is to get his students to think for themselves.  Do the readings, apply yourself, and you'll ace the class.  Professor Jordan made me love AFAM and I am currently pursuing a double major/minor in African American Studies."],"courses":["AFAM293","AAAD284","AAAD284","AAAD284","AAAD284","AAAD284","AFAM293","AFAM95","AFAM45140"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
