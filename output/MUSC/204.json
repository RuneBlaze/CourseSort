Jazz is a great class if you like the genre. Really personable guy outside of class too. Really encourage trying to get to know him if you have the opportunity.","Well, clearly some disagree, but I liked this guy. I will admit that the class is not exciting, but I liked it overall. He didn't use powerpoints very much, so you have to listen carefully in class. I thought he did a good job highlighting the important themes and trends of jazz. Tests were easy, papers were easy, quizes were the hardest part.","I'm going to have to disagree with the user below. Yes, Smith is very passionate about the subject, but my goodness was this class boring. I hoped to gain a greater love for jazz and instead wanted to hate it more and more with each class. This class was a HUGE disappointment for me, even though I made an A-. I would highly discourage this course.","Dr. Smith is simply amazing!!!! He is such a good flute player. He is a master of jazz history and teaches the subject as it should be taught-uses anecdotes and highlights the personalities of famous musicians. Only disappointment is he missed out on famous groups (ie Maynard, Brecker Brothers, Thad Jones) b/c he ran out of time at end of semester","Fairly easy class, but not the most interesting. You have to show up and pay attention to his lectures if you want to do well on tests, but the lectures get really boring. You do have to study hard for the tests/quizzes, but there's only like 5 of those. You listen to music in class, and most people should be able to get an A or B.","I'm going to have to disagree with some of these comments...Dr. Smith is passionate about this course - you can see it written all over his face - not to mention, he's very musically talented. He really wants YOU to love the music too - He seems like a pretty caring guy - study hard for the quizzes - tests are somewhat easier, ironically enough.","Reading and taking notes on the reading is a must to do well on tests/quizzes.  Also helpful to pay attention in lectures, though much of the information is anecdotal and unnecessary.  Great music, though, and I feel like I've learned alot aobut jazz.","before taking this class, i was excited to learn about jazz.  but professor smith's monotone-style, reading-out-of-the-book lectures put me to sleep.  the tests consist of questions that have not been discussed; instead, rote memorization of out-of-context facts is required to &quot;do well&quot; in the course.  in other words, you learn nothing useful.","No Comments","If he doens't want you in his program, you won't be there. He's very selective of his favorites and isn't willing to really work with his students. Almost like he's afraid of a challenge.","U need to appear in class and seriously study before quizzes/exams to do good, but it's worth it. You don't need to know anything about music beforehand, but if u aren't hooked on jazz after or still don't have a clue, clearly something's wrong - with u! An awesome experience/class, fabulous music!"],"courses":["MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC145","MUSC45","JAZZ","FLUTESTUDIO","MUSC45"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
