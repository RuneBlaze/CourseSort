Not only has he mastered the material he teaches, he somehow manages to make it relevant to modern life. He is also quite gifted at getting students to speak in class. Also, he's hands down one of the kindest professors I've ever met.","He teaches you how to think.","The greatest.","Professor Goldberg is the best professor at UNC.  I've never met someone so knowledgeable and passionate about the subjects he teaches.  The reading is time consuming, but the discussions are eye-opening and fascinating.  Take his class if you truly want to learn about the human condition.","The. Absolute. Best. I'm a sophomore, I regret not taking his classes last year, and I will be in an HNRS 354 class with him every semester until I graduate. I've learned so much. He is absolutely brilliant and, somehow, our discussions get at the heart of life--because isn't that the true point of education&#63;","The best of the best. Do not leave Carolina without taking at least one semester of the &quot;Elements of Politics&quot; cycle. One of the last true members of the academy.","Don't take one of his classes unless you actually want to dedicate your life to whatever the class is about. It's impossible to do more than 10% of the reading if you have ANY other priorities. A lot of people are really into class discussions. Secretly, I think they're crazy. Go for it if you want, but approach with caution.","Prof. Goldberg is a sage - a true philosopher - if I could choose the next President, it'd be him - I can't express how much I respect him and how grateful I've been for the opportunity to take five classes with him - I learned more in any given session of those classes than in all the other classes I took at Carolina.","Very intelligible about subject matter and is able to convey a sumblime import as well, overall one of the best classes i've attended","I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant and engaging this guy is. You will never regret a moment spent in his class. Also, he's incredibly nice and grades very leniently, provided that you keep up with your reading.","Hands down the best professor at Chapel Hill. If you leave without taking his class, you're missing out.","lots of reading, lots of short papers, but this guy is awesome! A great class for those who like to think and tease out ideas.","The best professor at UNC. Don't leave the school without taking Honors 32.","raises interesting points in class, not a heavy load as far as papers, but you had better do your reading, can get tiresome occasionally","probably the best professor at UNC","clearly a genius","No Comments"],"courses":["HONORS354","HNRS354","HNRSHNRS","HNRS354","HNRS354","HNRS32","HNRS354","HNRS32","HNRS31","HONORS32","HNRS32","HONORS32","HNRS32","ENGLISH29","HNRS32","ENGL58","HNRS32"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
