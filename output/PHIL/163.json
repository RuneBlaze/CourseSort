There are definitely a lot of long, sometimes confusing readings, but you always understand them better after the class that discusses that reading. You have to reach a certain number of participation points by the end of the semester so stay on top of it. She's always there to help and is so open minded."],"courses":["PHIL101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME"]}}]
