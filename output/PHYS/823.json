Her lectures are straight from the book. The tests are easy if you study but nothing like the examples from class. you will basically have to teach yourself.","If you see Dolan as professor, change your class or wait for the next semester.","Going to lectures is basically useless. The questions on the test are very different than the examples used in class or the homework problems. She speaks very low, so to hear anything she says you must sit in the front. Very, very boring.","Just as said before, easy tests, lecture not really helpful if you can understand the book, I recomend this prof if all you need is the credit.","Her lectures are basically comprised of a lot of examples.  I skipped a lot of classes b/c I kept falling asleep.  Her tests are moderate to easy (depends if you study and memorize the equations), but there are only 10 MC... so if you miss one, it hurts a lot!"],"courses":["PHYS104","PHYS104","PHYS104","PHYS124","PHYS24"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR"]}}]
