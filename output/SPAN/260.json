I wish I had taken more classes with him.","it was very entertaining having alan as a professor. he is very nice and knowledgable. the class is very laid back","I would say this is definitely the professor to take if you're just trying to finish your FL credit. He makes tests as easy as he can (listening sections) and doesn't assign much homework, especially toward the end of the semester. However, if you want to actually learn Spanish, he's probably not the best choice. He's pretty confusing sometimes","He's very easy. If you're serious about learning Spanish, I'd say that you should opt for someone a little more difficult. If you don't care about learning and just want FL credit, he's the man for you. Very little homework, very easy grading on the tests.","If you take this class and do the work (basic worksheet style), you will pass. This class, however, was awful to sit through. Despite talking in English a LOT, he was still impossible to understand when he taught grammar. Does not finish sentences!! He ended up waxing philosophical the whole time... and being rather rude when students didn't agree.","Prof Re is awesome. He really knows the subject and you can ask him any question. Very flexible and open. He really helps a lot.","Professor Re**** is easy going, very relax and knowledgeable. He doesn't teach much yet he guides well. I only needed a D to graduate and was not planning to study much, however, I did a lot of homework without even being aware. His class was super fun and I learned a great deal. Highly recommend his class!","Redik is a SUPER EASY teacher, and pretty chill. however, he refuses to teach actual spanish. A nice guy, though.","Prof. Re**** is hard. At the first part of the semeste he kills you with homeworks but then you set you free. He lets you work on your own terms. I ended with an A and I was expecting a C+ hen I started. He knows what he is doing.","This is the easiest professor I have ever had at Carolina. HOWEVER, he will not teach you anything. He refuses to help in class and tells people to look up answers online instead. I want to minor in Spanish and if you want to learn at all DO NOT take this class.","Great professor. Very intelligent and extremely knowledgeable. The discussions are highly philosophical and he will help you a lot with your grammar.","Alan is the man. He grades great, but he will teach if you are interested. He helped me out when I asked. He only cares about grammar when you write compositions, not so much subject matter.","Pretty cool guy. The readings are really hard of you are coming from SPAN 204. They are do-able though. He gives a lot of help on what to know for the test so pay attention on review days!

Definitely the most I've ever learned of a language in one semester.","LOVE HIM. very tough, but it's hard not to like him. Spanish 260 was my favorite class, because it was actually interactive. He got us to participate daily. If you do the readings and study all the time, it won't be too bad. Expect pop quizzes and he's also a harsh grader!","THE BEST PROFESSOR I have ever had. He is a kind and caring professor, a joy to talk to, makes hilariously entertaining and yet educational powerpoints. Do everything you can to take a class with him. He is fantastic.","El profesor Gómez is an understanding, passionate, and funny teacher.

Show him you do as well and you're golden.","Gomez is quite possibly the greatest professor you will ever have.

If you work hard, participate and study you will do well. Go to his office hours!!","Professor Gómez is a fantastic teacher. He makes an effort to get to know all of his students and get them excited about learning Spanish. He's studied pretty much everything so if you have a question, he has the answer. Not the easiest professor, but certainly very rewarding.","A great guy, really interesting and really loves his students.  However, he does not make the class easy and 99% of the learning has to be done at home, out of the book, which sucks.  If you can easily learn Spanish on your own I would definitely recommend taking him over someone else but if you generally have a hard time I would reconsider SPAN204","Prof. Gomez clearly loves his job. He is very interesting and funny and makes classes easy to enjoy. He's a really wonderful professor.","Really nice guy!!! Go talk to him after class!!! He has some interesting stories to tell!!!! However,  he teaches way too much out of the book and I didn't learn much of anything in his class.  The book was really bad so the class was often boring.  Gomez is a great guy though.  Really cares about his students!","Best teacher ever, very funny and kind. The class is not hard at all and he grades easily on papers.","He is a great teacher who loves teaching Spanish.  He is probably the best professor I have had at UNC.  Definitely take his class if you have the chance - you will not regret it.  He keeps things funny during class and is very laid back during class.","He's a sweet man who cares about teaching a lot. He's very non-threatening which makes it easy to worry less about mistakes. I've had nothing but good professor in this department, but he was by far the best.","AMAZING! one of the best spanish  professors I've had so far - he's extremely enthusiastic and his little Powerpoints are wonderful - and sometimes humorous. fun class - just participate, don't worry about messing up. He's not intimidating at all and will help you with whatever you need.","He was an amazing professor! He was so interested in his subject and his powerpoints were a little slice of heaven!
