I was shocked by how difficult biology became, since I always made A's in every biology class I took in high school. Go to the lectures for online participation but don't expect to better understand material. She makes class content confusing and doesn't offer much help for students.","I like Dr. Evans but I hated having her in class. She treated us like we were children, and the videos we watched were not very helpful. My main problem with her was the fact that she was very rude during office hours. She made me feel like I was wasting her time by being there. Also she loves trick questions, so watch out.","Evans didn't her use her time wisely in class. She made the class watch videos that just made the content even more confusing. It is a very flipped classroom and tests are difficult, however... she lets you drop your lowest exam grade which is nice. If you want to do well in this class, you must work for it.","She can hold a laser pointer extremely steady, it's actually quite uncanny","Dr. Evans was not a very good lecturer, in fact she didn't really lecture at all. She asks you questions to discuss with your neighbor, but then she never tells you the correct answers to the questions. I found her annoying and not very helpful.","great professor but she makes you learn it through in class discussion and activities","I don't know what the other ratings on here are talking about because I loved Dr. Evans. As a junior I have taken a multitude of other biology classes and found Dr. Evans to be one of the most helpful & clear professors. With participation in lecture I needed minimal work outside the class to secure an A. LOVED her so ignore other posts & take her","This class is easy. If you know the basics of biology its pretty much an easy A. You don't need the test book at all or need to show up to class. I skipped class over ten times and still have an A in the course. The only difficult part is maybe the first section but as long as you show up to the SI session you will get all the material need.","All of her tests except for the first one are easy. At the end of the Semester I did not show up to class for over a month and still have a high A going into the final. Dr. Evans however is not a very good teacher, she is terrible at explaining things and spends all of her class time focusing on topics not relevant to the tests. Would not recommend","She doesn't teach. Be prepared to \"turn to the person next to you to discuss\" during the lecture. But good luck because they probably don't know what's going on either!","Hour&15 minute long lectures are usually based on \"group\" discussion of a worksheet of questions that could be answered individually in less than 15 minutes. Often gives incorrect information during class, asks test questions that are purposely misleading. Make sure you DO overthink test questions, the answer is often not what seems most logical.","I really enjoyed this class. The lectures are usually pretty fun even if you have to learn outside the class by doing the homework. The first unit is A LOT harder than the others, so don't be daunted. The first unit has a lot more homework and a harder test. After that, though, most of the class is very basic vocabulary and pretty logical.","Doesn't teach. There are times where she doesn't know what she's talking about and can't help solve problems because she can't do them herself.","Live by the text book and you still won't succeed. Ask her questions and she will just read off of her notes again.","Dr. Evans is not a good teacher. She spends too much time on irrelevant things during lecture when we could have gone over important material from the tests. She asks a lot of questions that no one knows the answer to. Tests are nothing like the material she goes over in class. Very difficult.","Dr. Evans is enthusiastic and caring, but I would HIGHLY recommend taking Hogan instead. Dr. Evans is still new to teaching, and it shows. There were questions on exams that had NO RIGHT ANSWER. The lectures are all about trying to learn from classmates who also don't know anything. If you can teach yourself and go to SI, you'll be alright though.","Go to office hours!","I basically used the textbook to teach myself, and lectures were nothing but working with the people around you and you never got the correct answers to questions. 12","Dr. Evans doesn't lecture. She wants you to work with the people around you to learn and doesn't always give the correct answers to her guided notes/outlines for the powerpoints.","Took this class as a prereq for pre-med, she's a really nice person and loved meeting her! It was her first year teaching and I studied a lot for this class so I did well, but I know that some people didn't really like her. If you take notes on your own and go to class you will be fine.
