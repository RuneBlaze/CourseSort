The quizzes are manageable as long as you study the slides, however she does look for detailed answers. The final was just like the quizzes, and the final paper was manageable as long as you started it in advanced. 10/10 would take this class again.","Ehhhh. I didn't really enjoy the class. She's a tough grader.","She was a good teacher, and I learned a lot about global policy issues, which was the goal. Four quizzes, one final exam: they were easy as long as you studied her lecture slides. Huge 10pg paper on a foreign policy issue. And short blogs every week; she graded very harshly on the blogs, but if you do well in everything else you can get an A.","Best class I have taken at UNC! Kind of tough grader on papers but very helpful and enthusiastic. Best teacher I've had too. Explains things very well and very engaging in recitation. Would take this class again in a heartbeat. 5 quizzes- 1 dropped, couple blogs 300-700 words, 8-10 page paper, and decently easy final. Take this class.","Do not do it. She's rude to students and way too controlling over student work. This class wouldn't have been so bad if I had had the other instructor as my main instructor. I'd avoid."],"courses":["PLCY110","PLCY110","PLCY110","PLCY110","PLCY393"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR"]}},{"subject":"PLCY","catalog_nbr":110,"section":1,"class_nbr":8933,"title":"GLOBAL POLICY ISSUES","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Hanes Art Center","room":"0121","days":"TuTh","time":"12","instructor":"Zimmerman,Brigitte","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["SS"],"enrl_cap":160,"enrl_tot":153,"wait_cap":10,"wait_tot":7,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2081903","fname":"Brigitte","lname":"Zimmerman","quality":"5.0","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"Hilarious (2)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["EXTRA CREDIT","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["I loved Dr. Zimmerman!
