YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["She is a pretty tough grader - compared to my SPAN105 teacher, she was MUCH more difficult. Extremely hard on participation grades - didn't let me \"make up\" credit when I was in the HOSPITAL (though I did end up with a 90, after going to class every single time afterwards and participating my ass off). However she is fluent and gives great info.","She is a pretty strict grader, especially compared to the other SPAN 203 teachers. She does not explain why she marks off most of the time when you ask her. She also marks down on the entire class for participation grade, which should be an automatic A if you pay attention and show up to class. However, she does not treat it like this.","I thought the class was really easy. Especially for the 4th level of college spanish. yeah she gives a lot of quizzes but they are incredibly easy. she tests and grades really fairly. the assignments are pretty easy too. she isn't the most helpful professor but she is nice and you should pull an A or B with little effort","The reading is what's killer--expect a fair amount of homework every night. The analyzing isn't that bad once you get used to it, but if you don't pay attention in class you're screwed on the tests! Expect questions on exact quotations, themes, authors, time periods, cultural differences between countries, etc.","Assigns a lot of homework, especially nights before tests, so on top of studying for an exam, you have to worry about doing the assignments. Quizzes and in class essays almost everyday in class. Impractical grading scale-do better on in class rough draft comps verses final drafts. Does not make herself accessible for outside help. Avoid this class!","She's really nice and the class is pretty easy, especially if you have a good background in Spanish and can put together a half-decent essay. I think its as interesting as you make it- if you read and think about it, class is a lot more interesting because you will have more to add.","She's a mediocre teacher. She's good about sensing whether or not class is ready for upcoming tests, etc. and she'll change dates around. Do the homework. She's not that easy, but at this level, easiness shouldn't really be expected. Overall, the class isn't that bad.","She is a good teacher but she is not an easy one. If you want to continue on further in spanish then take her.","She's a fair grader and will postpone quizzes or speak in English if she can tell the class isn't doing well.  She's cool.","No Comments"],"courses":["SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN204","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN21","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN003"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
