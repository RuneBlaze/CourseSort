His class was fascinating and he delivers lectures that are interesting and understandable. He also has an adorable habit of describing dates that scientists aren't too sure on as &quot;squishy&quot;. Tests are doable, though it helps if you take good notes. Recitations are rather pointless, and the TAs are incredibly sanctimonious.","Unless you need this class for your major, do not sign up for it. He give you study guides, but half the time he majorly deviates from them. The recitation are a waste of time: You don't learn anything the book can't teach you. The T.A.'s can't teach, and don't even grade your work.","He loves teaching, and is very approachable. I don't know where people get that he's not a very nice guy. Attend class every day, study your notes, do the study guides, and you will do fine.","He's a very nice guy and he loves what he teaches.  I would strongly reccomend taking a class by him.","Clear lectures, interesting topics.   Students are always clear about what is expected of them.  Friendly and nice.","Clear lectures and doable homework, challenging tests.  Sorensen tends to shy away from helping me in one on one conversations though, and tends to be very difficult to get any kind of help from.  Not friendly at all."],"courses":["ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH148","ANTH318","ANTH318","ANTH148"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
