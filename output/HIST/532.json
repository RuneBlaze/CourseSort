This class really opened my eyes!!!","This class is wonderful. Lectures were fascinating and always kept my attention, he teaches Cuban history as if he's storytelling. Yes, the class is painfully hard. Do all the reading, make notecards to remember names, go to office hours, think critically about the material. He can tell if you're making an effort, and that will make a difference.","Outstanding lecturer, but this class is extremely difficult. There are only two exams and no other grades (not even participation). The subject is very interesting, but don't take this class if you are only casually interested in history or latin america.","Without a doubt one of THE hardest classes I've taken at UNC. But absolutely one of the best. If you want a good grade you'll have to work your butt off and office hours are a must. You have to read and remember names. BUT I learned a ton; this class transformed my world view. If you are curious about Cuba, TAKE IT.","do not take","Dr. Perez is engaging and funny, and his lectures keep you interested while still explaining complex topics. History of Cuba is really difficult but I definitely recommend it, especially if you plan to apply to study in Havana while at UNC.","Dr. Perez is a very fair grader, but be prepared to copy notes furiously. Bring a tape recorder and highlight everything he writes on the board. Make sure you make note cards with every notable person in the reading, as these are all hot points on the tests. He is very enthusiastic about the subject and it is very easy to share that enthusiasm.","The class is interesting and it is obvious that Dr. Perez is very passionate about the subject and truly knows a lot about Cuban history. However the grading is harsh and working hard in this class does NOT necessarily mean you will do well!!! If you are concerned with your GPA I would NOT reccomend this class","This class was literally the most engaging class I've taken at UNC. He is an outstanding lecturer. I made a B in the class and worked hard, but I'm looking beyond that. He is the top scholar on Cuba, and man does it show in the classroom. Any serious student of Latin America cannot afford to miss his class.","Dr. Perez is incredible!  Truly one of the world's top Cuba scholars, and definitely #1 in the USA!  UNC is very fortunate to have him.  I agree that he is one of the most engaging, witty lecturers I've ever seen.  He grades fairly but demands a lot of his students.  Never be late!  Take his class before he retires!","wow! this is an entertaining class. it's a lot more like watching a play than listening to a history lecture. he is very animated. the readings are helpful, he is a fair grader, and is always available and happy to assist students during his office hours. yes, you have to work hard. yes, it pays off. you leave with a greater understanding of cuba.","Dr. Perez is amazing. His lectures are awesome and enlightening, despite the difficulty and complexity of the subject I feel like Perez did a great job covering Cuban history and Cuban-US relations. I would reccomend this class to anyone willing to put in the work. It is not an easy class but it is worthwhile.","The class was great; the person who wrote that Dr. Perez is a &quot;propagandist for Castro&quot; should have been listening in class, because that's far from the truth; of course it's pretty difficult to study Latin America without criticizing US foreign policy occasionally, which perhaps is what offended this guy.","I wanted to like this class so much, i did the readings, never missed class, had a solid background in the subject and it came down to him not liking my writing style, on our basically one exam that was our only grade. it was too bad too work so hard and get a c. it would be difficult to recommend though he is very passionate about the subject.","Absolutely brilliant! Perez is the foremost scholar on Cuban History in the nation and one of the most eloquent, insightful and witty lecturers the University has. His Cuba Hist class is brutally difficult (the only grades are a quiz worth 10% and two exams worth 45% each), but you will learn!","This dude has emotional issues with Cuba. He is a propagandist for the Castro dictatorship. Needs to get a life!","This was a wonderful class.  As long as you do the readings and attend class you will do just fine.  He really draws you in during class.  I definetely recommend this class and I am not even a history major.","Overrated and overpaid. Should get his head out of the clouds and retire.","No Comments"],"courses":["HIST326","HIST532","HIST532","HIST532","HIST532","HIST532","HIST143","HIST532","HIST532","HISTMANY","HIST532","HIST532","HST176","HIST176B","HIST176B","HISTORYOFCUBA","HISTORYOFCUBA","HIST","HIST176B"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}}]
