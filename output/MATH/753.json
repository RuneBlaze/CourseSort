She loses her thought process and can ramble, leaving students confused as to what to write down. Her mid terms were not very hard but if you accidentally make a mistake, you'll regret it because there is very little partial credit. Her final was extremely hard.","How does she even have this high of a rating? She does not give partial credit (which is ridiculous for a math class) and is very opposed to answering any questions about tests. You can do poorly in this class even if you understand the material.  She also grades attendance and doesn't really tell you that until the end of class...","Hawkins is a very good and clear lecturer. She's very helpful if you ask her questions in class. I really liked that about her.  HOWEVER, she's a hard grader! Her tests are easy, but if you make one, silly mistake, she gives almost no partial credit (if at all!). So for a test with only five questions, it's very easy to do very poorly.","Jane Hawkins and extremely rude and gets mad when students ask simple questions. She takes off full points for simple algebra mistakes and doesn't care about her 383 students. I could not recommend this professor to anyone.","Really cares about the class and making sure we understand the material. That said, you need to put effort into it on your own time, otherwise there's no way you'll be prepared. Lecture was helpful.","Terrible teacher. She is knowledgeable about the material but has trouble explaining it. You have to teach yourself. Exams are very hard and she grades harshly. She is a nice person but I still recommend taking MATH 521 with someone else.","Great teacher! This course is very challenging but her tests are pretty fair.","Honestly, I love this professor. Her class is no where close to easy but is upper level math so it is expected to be difficult. If you go to her office hours, she is extremely helpful and does everything she can to help you understand. Shes' hard to catch outside of office hours but she will try to be flexible. Tests are fair and similar to hw.","Good teacher. She teaches hard classes so some may not like her because of that.  She is not easy, but is fair if you work hard.","Quite scatter-brained -- was probably thinking about her research instead of the class.  Very smart woman, but not the best teacher -- ended up making many mistakes on board, but she knew what she was doing.  Tests weren't too bad.  If you study & do hw, you'll do fine.  Math center can be helpful.","No Comments","she is not too hard, but she is difficult to catch outside of class for questions...does not answer email","No Comments"],"courses":["MATH383","MATH383","MATH383","MATH383","MATH521","MATH521","MATH521","MATH383","MATH521","MATH32","MATH83","MATH125","MATH032"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
