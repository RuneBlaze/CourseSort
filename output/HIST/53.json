The class doesn't have much work other than short weekly readings, but you will have to study for the exams because they did cover tedious material.","1. Professor Kramer is precious 2. Take this class  There isn't really any work for this class on a day-to-day basis, but you definitely have to study for the tests. Professor Kramer is a super nice guy if you ever go to office hours, and I was never bored during his lectures. I definitely recommend taking a class from him if you can!","Interesting class, but not an easy A by any means.","Nothing's changed since 2005 (see below). Great guy and professor, but he has the TAs grade stuff absurdly hard. So if you're looking for an easy A, he's not your guy. But if you just want to learn and are ok with something in the B range then definitely take a class with him.","Kramer is very good! His lectures are funny and interesting. There's about 20 - 50 pages to read a week but it's not on the test so basically optional. He gives interesting antedates but normally you don't have to write them down so it's not hard to take notes. His few tests were not hard because you didn't have to answer everything.","Interesting class with about average work schedule.","Great class.  Great professor.","Kramer is the best professor at UNC!  He's brilliant and hilarious.","I really liked Kramer.  He's just a genuine, funny guy who obviously enjoys teaching.  He made the course very pleasant.  The lectures did get a bit redundant (partly because there was so much material to cover), but he did a good job keeping things interesting.  Kramer does a good job teaching but TA's grade harshly.  I still came out with a B+.","Dr. Kramer is definitely one of the best professors at UNC and made me consider becoming a history major. He keeps his lectures interesting and his passion for the course material is inspiring. He is really funny too and you should definitely take a history course with him.","Excellent Professor, he was extremely helpful and made the classes interesting.  All you need to watch out for are the TA's (they grade pretty hard)","Great, funny, engaging professor. One of the best at UNC- its professors like him who convinced me to major in history. For a huge survey class, the lectures are well done and tests are pretty straightforward (but graded by TAs). If you need, or even just want, a history class, you cannot go wrong with Kramer.","BEST history teacher I have ever had.  I have never really enjoyed history before but Kramer makes it enjoyable.  Lectures are enjoyable and class goes by quickly.  You won't regret having a class with him.","awesome teacher! if you, like me, are not too thrilled about history but have to take one for your perspective, this is the guy you want! made history lectures funny and interesting! tests are not too hard but the grading is a little strict. also, if you go to every lecture and take good notes, there is no point in buying the textbook.","good lectures, easy tests graded by crazy hard TAs","very good!","BORING BORING BORING","Hilarious and brilliant.  The best professor you will ever have in your miserable little life.","I agree with the reviewer above.  It's been almost 3 years since I had his class but I think he was the best teacher I had at UNC.","This guy is amazing. He is humorous and respectful. It is obvious that he cares about his students.  He makes history come alive.  Professor Kramer is probably the best professor in the entire history department at UNC-CH.  I recommend him highly."],"courses":["HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HISTORY","HST151","HST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST151","HIST011","HIST011","HIST11","HIST11","HISTORY126","WESTERNCIVI","HIS1"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
