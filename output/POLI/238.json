Huber is really helpful when it comes to preparing for the midterm/final, but she can tend to be dry during lectures. She puts all her Powerpoints online, so it's not completely necessary to read the book, although it's helpful.","Dr. Huber is definitely an expert at Contemporary Latin American Politics, but she has problems conveying her knowledge to the students. This exams are essay based and pretty comprehensive, but not too difficult if you come to class and go to recitation. Grade consists of Mid Term, Final, Research Paper, and Recitation participation.","Interesting course material, but Professor Huber tends to be dry.  She does not allow laptops and lectures from a powerpoint every class.  The exams are somewhat detailed but not difficult if you come to lecture and pay attention.  She does grade on a curve, based on how the TA's grade you.  I would recommend this course only to POLI majors.","Pros: She is clearly an expert in her field and is good at explaining things. Cons: Lectures could get kind of boring and we couldn't use laptops, which made it challenging to take notes because she talks kind of fast. Overall, this class is difficult but I would still recommend her as a professor.","Avoid at all costs.","She was a good Prof.  The class could get pretty boring, but she tried.  She is most def one of those people that would probably do better in a small class.  The exams and pop quizzes are that hard as long as you do the reading.  The amount of reading does suck.","Latin American Politics - pretty boring class, questions on tests asked for minute details which you probably wouldn't think were that important in the readings.  She grades really hard, as well...I didn't really like this class at all","I can't remember the exact number of this class since courses changed, but it was Latin American Politics.  She is the worse teacher probably in the Poli Sci Dept. She's a complete communist... Everything wrong in Latin America is the CIA's fault according to her- no detail into economics of the turmoilous political climate.  Hard and worthless!","If you are interested in Latin American politics you will do alright, but if not- there is little she does to get you interested.  It is also a lot of reading and mid terms/ final is in class essay so you really have to know your stuff.","So incredibly boring, does little to engage the class, I fall asleep almost every time","The only class I've ever fallen asleep in"],"courses":["POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI238","POLI265","POLI86","POLI56","POLI56","POLI56"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR"]}}]
