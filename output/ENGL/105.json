He is one of my favorite professors at UNC. He is very knowledgable and definitely a unique professor. He is always there for his students and helped me develop a higher level writing style. He often goes on tangents, but they are always very interesting. I highly recommend taking his 105 and ENGL137.","Henry is very unconventional. The class is all discussion based and he usually lets the students determine what exactly you will be talking about. No tests and the reading is really unnecessary. He's a cool guy and as long as you participate and he can see that you're trying you will get a good grade.","Henry is great and really smart. He always tells you exactly what to do and lets you revise stuff a million times before you hand it in. I actually learned a lot in his class, even though I am not a huge fan of writing papers. Sometimes, he goes off on tangents but I always find his stories interesting and fun. Wouldn't mind having him again.","BEST PROFESSOR EVER, super understanding. Goes on a few rants in class but always interesting. Take him if you have the chance, you won't regret it!!!","He's a great professor! He gives a lot of busy work in the beginning, though. He requires you to post intermediate steps in writing paper, which can be annoying, but it stopped me from procrastinating. He grades pretty easy, and I think he is looking for improvement.","Fabulous Professor! Although most of the time he lectured on other things that didn't pertain to English, he was very interesting to listen to and is very intelligent. If you show an effort, you will do well in the class. It is possible to get a high grade in his class. You do have to buy the textbook however because you use it a good amount.","FABULOUS PROFESSOR. I loved his class. The material wasn't easy but his attitude and teaching skills make it an easy A. He's wonderful. 1010 definitely recommend!","He's such a chill guy, if you show up to class and write a decent paper you'll get an A. He grades a lot based on effort and he's very forgiving (I was sick for 2 weeks and he let me turn in everything later for full credit) I highly recommend taking him for 105","This class is relatively easy, but it is still not a joke. He takes writing very seriously. A paper was due about every week. Most lectures are completely unrelated to english, but he was an interesting professor.","Super intelligent. Although his instructions are not always clear, he is understanding and willing to help and encourages students to take chances in order to improve their writing. Very practical grader (as in he grades for grammar/technique/coherence instead of content), as well--so you don't have to worry if your beliefs don't match his.","Henry is very interesting to listen to.  Extremely knowledgable and passionate about teaching.  I enjoyed his class and the assignments were few and fairly easy.  If you want him to like you, participate.","Henry is one of the best professors I've had at UNC. I feel like out of all the classes I had my first semester at UNC, he was the one I learned the most from. Don't be afraid to talk in class and as long as you put in some effort, you'll be just fine. Can't wait to take his contemporary lit class!","Professor Veggian is nice but his assignments are really random. His directions aren't very clear and kind of expects you to know all this stuff you are talking about. Talk in his class and ask questions because his assignments are weird.","His courses are very reading intensive but the essays are short, open-ended, and graded easily.  I probably only finished about 4 books this semester and still made an A in the course. The class was kind of weird and I could never quite tell what direction we were going in but overall it was interesting.  Speak up or else he'll pick on you.","dr. veggian is the best teacher that i've ever had at carolina.  if all college professors were like him i'd never want to leave college.  literally he is that friendly and helpful.  take his class if you want to actually learn and succeed.","The class is easy and the material is, too, and if you put forth any effort you will do fine.  The writing assignments are open-ended so it is not very hard to do well on those.

If you put in effort for the class, a good grade can be achieved. I definitely recommend!","Dr. Frost is the best professor I have ever had!  Her class is so much fun, and I learned a lot.  I strongly recommend taking her classes!","Leslie Frost is my favorite professor at UNC. I loved her class she was extremely helpful. Almost all the readings were available online. Take a class with Leslie Frost.","Dr. Frost is a great teacher, especially for english 105. She divided are small class into groups and every group in our class got along so well. The class dynamic was great, she often didn't hold class, and was very understanding about assignments. The class only had 3 projects and each was set up very well. Highly recommend her!","I would really recommend Dr. Frost.  She was an excellent English teacher who taught with clarity and provided interesting and accommodating projects that helped me acclimate to college-level work and research. She is experienced and willing to go out of her way to help you.  Also very interesting.  Ask her about living in Turkey.","This class is honestly a lot more work than what I expected for an English 101 class and her late/attendance policy is a bit over the top. In the end, she is a great professor that makes an effort to get to know you and is always available in office hours. The class is intellectually engaging and class time is enjoyable. But, again, a lot of work.","She is really earthy and fun! But she gets frustrated when everyone doesn't participate in group discussion. So if you're not a big talker...don't take her. She has her favorites. Her class really doesn't make sense, but it isn't hard to do well in it. Tons of readings...i never read and I did quite alright!","Dr. Frost is extremely helpful. I have never enjoyed an English class so much.","There's quite a lot of readings, A LOT of class discussion, which i hate. but if you like it, you'll love her class probably","I hate english, but loved this class. It was very interesting, & all assignments were based on the West Memphis 3 murder trials. There are 3 big assignments and 4-6 small ones, but none are too hard. She holds office hours a lot and is willing to help you with papers. If you don't usually enjoy english classes, I strongly recommend taking from her.","Excellent Professor! Take if you can. She makes class interesting. There is a fair amount of work - 3 units with one or two feeders each. Nothing outrageous. Class structure is great - our class had the consistent theme of the West Memphis 3 for all assignment. Again, take her class if possible!","Interesting class, yet requires attendance and alot of work, but it is worth it in the end. Class participation is strongly encouraged and is a large part of the final grade. She is helpful but difficult to get in touch with.","Not that difficult. She's a little eccentric, and always reminded me of Miss Frizzle. I would recommend the class to anyone who has to fulfill this requirement.","Great professor. I decided to take her for English 102 as well. This class isn't just a walk in the park, as attendance and actual work is required, but, in return you get an enthusiastic professor who's not afraid to let students out early, bring breakfast to class. or get off topic. Actually learned a lot from this class. Worth taking.","No Comments"],"courses":["ENGL105","126","ENGL128","ENG105","ENGL126","ENGL122","ENGL105","ENGL102","ENGL101","ENGL128","ENGL101","ENGL128","ENGL102","ENGL102","ENG102","ENGL101","ENGL101","ENG122"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":105,"section":28,"class_nbr":7097,"title":"ENG COMP & RHETORIC","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0107","days":"MWF","time":"13","instructor":"COHEN,MARC D","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["CR"],"enrl_cap":19,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=962646","fname":"Marc","lname":"Cohen","quality":"4.4","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Gives good feedback (6)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["PARTICIPATION MATTERS","AMAZING LECTURES","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","SKIP CLASS?

He helped me improve my writing so much!","He brought us Krispy Kreme doughnuts. What more do you want? He is incredibly willing to help students by giving feedback on papers before they are due. He genuinely wants all of his students to do well and improve their writing.","He's the bomb. Bought us donuts at the end too.","Dr. Cohen is really helpful in office hours. He really makes himself as available as possible for his students. He gives amazing feedback on papers.

He is always so willing to help and really wants you to improve your writing in his class, which you definitely will. Definitely go see him in office hours, he'll tell you exactly what he wants to see in your writing.","Professor Cohen is a solid teacher. He is always in a good mood and excited to teach class. For our exams, we had to write essays and short answers, but he literally gives you exactly what is going to be on the test beforehand. He's really happy when you speak up in class or even just stay to talk a bit after class. Great experience overall!","Prof. Cohen goes above and beyond to help students. Your grade will be influenced by how much you utilize this help but he's very fair and the grading contract really helps.","Super awesome Professor, extremely helpful, my favorite professor yet","amazing professor! he goes out of his way to help you but his grades are based on how much you've improved so its a little difficult if you are a good writer but he really is awesome and if you do all your work then a moderately easy A.","Very helpful and interested in this subject.  Grading contract makes it east to get at least a B+.","The class is a lot harder if you are a skillful writer. He grades based on improvement, so if you don't have a lot to improve on at a 101 level, you're pretty much screwed.","At first, he it seems as if he will be a very helpful and insightful professor. However, as the semester wears on, it becomes evident that he establishes impossible standards for his students. He also puts a large amount of emphasis on personal preference. If he does not like a student for any reason, it will be very difficult to get a good grade.","Even though I have only attended UNC for one full year, Professor Cohen is the best professor that i have had thus far and will be tough to beat by any other professor in the future.  He was always willing to meet with you outside of class, which was a huge help for me.  After having Professor Cohen for two semesters, I can guarantee you that the grade you get for the class will reflect the effort that you put into it.  I highly reccomend that you take his class if you have the opportunity.","overall great teacher","He is very approachable.

Always available to talk before or after class and in her office hours. If you are thinking about taking 105i, TAKE BUSI 105i it is unbelievably easy. The most I wrote for an assignment was maybe two pages.","Super exciting and makes not so interesting material interesting. Really love her class and would take it again just for fun. Helpful, never patronizing (even if you ask a dumb question). Quizzes are super easy. Overall great professor and person","Professor Geil is the best! I took her for Popular Genres and it was my favorite class at UNC. She is very excited about teaching the class and willing to work with you if you need a deadline extension or something. Her quizzes are so easy and the class is actually fun. She grades on participation, so make sure to raise your hand. Highly recommend!","AMAZING professor!! she's flexible and understanding, but also sets reasonable expectations that aren't impossible to meet. She's open-minded and always willing to help a student.","I've only been at Chapel Hill for one semester, but thus far she is my FAVORITE professor by far. She makes class fun by being herself--which is corky and funny. She's a nerd and won't deny it. She's super understanding, helpful and encouraging. The biggest assignments we had were 7-8 paged paper and a group project. Fun class, fun teacher.","I took ENGL 105i - Writing in Business with Dr. Geil and it was a wonderful experience. I thought the class was very useful and I developed writing skills relevant to my future career. We also had a mock Shark Tank presentation, which was actually quite fun to work on. Learned a lot from Dr. Geil, guest presenters she brought in and my classmates.","Attendance is a must. Fair grader, very approachable and friendly. Two papers: One group based paper (5-6 pg) and Final paper (9-10 pg). Weekly quizzes-only to help boost your grade. 8-9 plays over the semester. Midterm: Snow days were a factor, so we had to write essays based on prompts. More  than likely you will take the standard midterm.","Dr. Geil was a wonderful and engaging instructor. She was willing to help with anything you needed and always took everyone in the classes' opinions into consideration. She illuminated the material in a way that seemed interesting to the whole class. (Oh, and she was occasionally hilarious.)","Take everything she teaches. She's funny and really knows her stuff. She pushed both papers back almost two weeks, and held extensive reviews for the midterm and final. Weekly quizzes are a great way to bolster your grade, and she drops the lowest one. She was always available for help with papers, and she'll even send promising sources your way.","Dr. Geil was so helpful and she was so entertaining. She kept her demeanor friendly and she was a bit quirky. She grades strictly, but fairly. The course was incredibly interesting and she was the primary reason for keeping it interesting as Shakespeare is sometimes difficult to grasp. I would absolutely recommend taking her class if you can."],"courses":["ENG105I","ENGL120","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL105","225","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENGL225"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":105,"section":5,"class_nbr":7064,"title":"ENG COMP/RHET (INTERDISC)","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0317","days":"MWF","time":"11","instructor":"O'Shaughnessey,MARGARET E","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CR"],"enrl_cap":19,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=98386","fname":"Margaret","lname":"O'Shaughnessey","quality":"3.7","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Gives good feedback (4)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SO MANY PAPERS","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA"],"comments":["If you ask for help, she'll give it to you.

Always available to talk before or after class and in her office hours. If you are thinking about taking 105i, TAKE BUSI 105i it is unbelievably easy. The most I wrote for an assignment was maybe two pages.","Super exciting and makes not so interesting material interesting. Really love her class and would take it again just for fun. Helpful, never patronizing (even if you ask a dumb question). Quizzes are super easy. Overall great professor and person","Professor Geil is the best! I took her for Popular Genres and it was my favorite class at UNC. She is very excited about teaching the class and willing to work with you if you need a deadline extension or something. Her quizzes are so easy and the class is actually fun. She grades on participation, so make sure to raise your hand. Highly recommend!","AMAZING professor!! she's flexible and understanding, but also sets reasonable expectations that aren't impossible to meet. She's open-minded and always willing to help a student.","I've only been at Chapel Hill for one semester, but thus far she is my FAVORITE professor by far. She makes class fun by being herself--which is corky and funny. She's a nerd and won't deny it. She's super understanding, helpful and encouraging. The biggest assignments we had were 7-8 paged paper and a group project. Fun class, fun teacher.","I took ENGL 105i - Writing in Business with Dr. Geil and it was a wonderful experience. I thought the class was very useful and I developed writing skills relevant to my future career. We also had a mock Shark Tank presentation, which was actually quite fun to work on. Learned a lot from Dr. Geil, guest presenters she brought in and my classmates.","Attendance is a must. Fair grader, very approachable and friendly. Two papers: One group based paper (5-6 pg) and Final paper (9-10 pg). Weekly quizzes-only to help boost your grade. 8-9 plays over the semester. Midterm: Snow days were a factor, so we had to write essays based on prompts. More  than likely you will take the standard midterm.","Dr. Geil was a wonderful and engaging instructor. She was willing to help with anything you needed and always took everyone in the classes' opinions into consideration. She illuminated the material in a way that seemed interesting to the whole class. (Oh, and she was occasionally hilarious.)","Take everything she teaches. She's funny and really knows her stuff. She pushed both papers back almost two weeks, and held extensive reviews for the midterm and final. Weekly quizzes are a great way to bolster your grade, and she drops the lowest one. She was always available for help with papers, and she'll even send promising sources your way.","Dr. Geil was so helpful and she was so entertaining. She kept her demeanor friendly and she was a bit quirky. She grades strictly, but fairly. The course was incredibly interesting and she was the primary reason for keeping it interesting as Shakespeare is sometimes difficult to grasp. I would absolutely recommend taking her class if you can."],"courses":["ENG105I","ENGL120","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL144","ENGL105","225","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENGL225"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":105,"section":66,"class_nbr":7124,"title":"ENG COMP & RHETORIC","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Bingham","room":"0301","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"HAMMER,BRADLEY AARON","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["CR"],"enrl_cap":19,"enrl_tot":19,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1938669","fname":"Bradley","lname":"Hammer","quality":"4.2","easiness":"2.4","help":"2.4","clarity":"2.4","topTag":"Respected (7)","grade":"2.4","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["AMAZING LECTURES","INSPIRATIONAL","RESPECTED","SKIP CLASS?

He helped me look at life from a new perspective. He genuinely cares about his students and loves his job. If you want an A, he will work with you to get an A. I learned so much and it has been the best class I've taken at UNC so far. Highly recommend!","Has to be one of the best professors at UNC. There is no one more keen to help his students and every single class is basically just story time where he imparts valuable knowledge. It was by chance that I got him as a professor and I feel incredibly lucky that I did","Lots of group works over the semester (especially towards the end), so it depends on whom you work with. He wants you to learn in class, so makes you work, but is very fair and makes getting an A very approchable.","One of the strangest classes I've ever taken. Every lecture consisted of him going on for over an hour about something unrelated to the topic (his daughter's horse) and he always ran out of time. However, he really cares about his students and makes it very possible to get an A in the class. I would recommend, but expect extremely boring lectures.","Dr. Hammer is wonderful. He is the most engaging teacher I've ever had. Expect to work for your grade, but the extra effort is completely worth it. I would take this class again just for fun","Here you have my favorite professor at UNC. The class is well organized, engaging, and generally a lot of fun. Dr. Hammer is the figurehead of this course and will learn you a thing so interesting you may fall out of your chair. I got through the week looking forward to his course. YOU MUST ATTEND CLASS.","Dr. Hammer made my first semester at UNC so much better than I had expected. I wasn't very excited to be taking an English class, but he made it into my favorite class of the semester. His lectures are fun and interesting. We were always very engaged, and he loved good conversation. I would highly recommend any of his classes!","Dr. Hammer was one of the best teachers I've ever had. It was a lot of work, but totally worth it. I took the Health and Medicine class and it was a huge help with those unfamiliar genres. He is a great professor, very engaging and interesting to listen to. We did get off track a lot, however, and ended up rushing the last unit. Great Class","Dr. Hammer always kept the class engaged, and was fantastic in the small class setting. Knew the students on a more personal level, and was incredibly helpful and engaging with them all.

She gives good feedback. I learned a lot about writing style in this class. It's an easy A if you put a little effort into it. It's a small classroom so she'll learn your name quickly and will ALWAYS be there if you need help.","All the unit projects assigned were easy to complete and the feeders felt graded fairly. Did learn some things about the writing styles in different disciplines but definitely just an appropriate amount for an introductory course. Participation in class is important, there is a lot of group discussion and  one group project. Overall, great prof!","Professor GR is such a great professor and so sweet. She provides personal feedback on all the work leading up to the unit project, which she grades rather easily. A lot of group work and projects, but an easy class. She always has a rubric and organized due dates. She makes a huge home cooked meal the last day, which just shows her generosity.","Excellent teacher, with a clear grading rubric (she's constantly telling you what you need in order to pass her class). Professor Gualtieri-Reed's style of Helicopter teaching helps you feel like you're getting individual attention. She knows everyone in her class, and doesn't hesitate to make jokes or laugh at jokes.
