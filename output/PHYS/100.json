Besides that, he is really great at making physics accessible for people that want to learn.  He really cares about giving you all the resources you need and is willing to help if you ask. Also sucks way less than any chem class.","Very unclear grading standards for labs, lecture doesn't help at all, you're teaching yourself only from the book (and chegg, if you're lucky). It's been the hardest class I've ever taken in my life. The homework takes hours, and you are graded (for accuracy) on \"warm-ups\", which are basically pre-quizzes on material that hasn't been covered yet","He is a good, mostly clear lecturer. He is always ready to help, but it is usually in a sarcastic of condescending tone. You can even see this in his forum posts to students asking questions.  His tests are difficult; he wants about a 70-75% average. Since the first test average was too high (78%), he made the next one much harder (68% average).","I currently have him as a physics coordinatormentor. He is a seriously amazing person and he genuinely cares for his students. Not easy though, but he's super willing to help out if you have questions.","Seriously awesome prof and an interesting guy. He's good with complicated concepts and really helpful outside of class. It seemed like half the class went to all his office hours. I'm pretty sure he worked in the private sector until recently, and career academics could learn a thing or two from him about how to teach."],"courses":["PHYS118","PHYS118","PHYS118","118","PHYS116"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
