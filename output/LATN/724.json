He likes getting into the text.  Do the translation work beforehand and come in with any questions and you should be fine.","Great Professor.  Study translations & you'll be fine. He explains everything that will be on the midterms beforehand, so there are no surprises.  Only covers books 1, 2, 4.  Professor Babcock doesn't review all the english translation, but does answer any grammatical question, then continues to focus on the latin text itself. Highly recommended."],"courses":["LATN221","LATN221"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
