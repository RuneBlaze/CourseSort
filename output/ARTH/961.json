I was fortunate to have her for the lecture and the recitation section. She was very into the subject she taught and would relate almost all of the art pieces to random stories she had (good for ADHD-minded people like me to connect ideas to). She was very helpful and clear about what she wanted.","Verkerk is very passionate about art history, and this makes lectures interesting! There are 3 exams (2 midterms and a final) that involve a lot of memorization (the work's name, time period, bracket dates, etc.) and a 10-page paper. They're fast-paced. My TA was great; however, my only complaint is that grading among the TAs was inconsistent.","Professor Verkerk is a kind professor. She is very passionate about her subject matter. The class itself is not hard. There are 2 tests and one 10 page paper. However, if you don't go to lecture and take notes, you will not do well on the tests. The tests are very  straightforward, but tons of memorization about 50 pieces of art is required.","Interesting and funny professor, and the course material is surprisingly interesting.  Unfortunately, the tests were rushed and difficult, the TA's grade inconsistently, and it is flat out a ton of memorization.  Not the worst class to have, but there are probably easier VP's to take.","Hilarious professor, probably my favorite so far. Material was very boring but she cracked jokes and made it bearable. No work other than 3 tests and 10 page paper. A lot of memorization on the tests. Paper was not that bad. I found that my brain switches to artsy mode around 3 am. She is a great professor but there are probably easier VP credits.","She makes it way harder than it needs to be and the TA's are viciously cruel and grade tests and the ten page paper harshly. AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS. NOT WORTH THE GEN ED FULFILLMENTS.","I really enjoyed her Art 151 class, and it was not too difficult. There is not much work throughout the semester, there is just a final paper and three exams.","Tests do not accurately or appropriately evaluate the students on their understanding of the material. Instead, they ask you to memorize facts about art instead of evaluating the art or appreciating the art in historical context. The TAs are hit or miss. Lectures move slowly.","Favorite class of the semester. Only took it as it covered a lot of Gen Ed requirements and has ended up being the most enjoyable of the semester. Verkerk is an engaging professor although the exams are hard. A series of definitions with 90 seconds for each, identification of sculptures/paintings-3 minutes each and then a 20 minute essay!","Verkerk is a fun professor, but her tests are unreasonably difficult when they should be much easier.  I knew all the information we needed to know but got poor grades on the exams because she intentionally rushes you (she told us we would probably not have enough time for the exam). Fun teacher, but bad class.","Outstanding Professor.","My favorite professor of my freshman year. I took art history as a whim and now its my major! Her lectures are engaging however coursework and tests can be very difficult.","Probably one of my favorite classes I have taken - and I'm an environmental science major. If you appreciate the material and are good at memorization this class easy. Pay attention during lectures, the  book isn't entirely necessary. Verkerk is a really great professor, she really is passionate about the class and is kind of funny at times","Dr. Verkerk is really fun and tries her best to make the lecture as interesting as possible. Reading isn't really necessary for this course as most of the test information is from lecture. Grades really come down to the individual TAs and how harshly they grade so try to find a good one.","slide shows are hard to pay attn to... really boring.","Teacher is funny and informative, but terrible textbook. If you already know a bit of art history like I did, dont take this. if the word &quot;contrapposto&quot; means nothing to you, go ahead, its a pretty good intro class.  The essay is easy and she give you all semester for it, the test isn't bad if you make flashcards and have a good memory for dates.","Decent class, the lectures are interesting. The recitations make me want to kill myself, though. They are about the longest fifty minutes of my life. She should try and make them more engaging. Maybe we could actually do art in the recitations.","She's funny, explains the subject in good detail, and makes even the prehistoric art interesting.","If you're an art history buff, you'll love this class.  Dr. Verkerk really tries to make things interesting.  Otherwise, those dark classrooms and slide shows will put you in a coma.","Good professor who knows her field, but good luck staying awake during lecture!  The paper is easy, but the tests are incredibly difficult, especially when there are tons of slides to memorize."],"courses":["ARTH151H","ARTH151","ARTH151","ARTH151","ARTH151","ARTH151","ARTH151","ARTH151","ART151","ART151","ART151","ART151","ART152","ART151","ART151","ART151","ART151","ARTHISTORY","ART31","ART31"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
