Theres a lot of reading in this class, so only take it if you actually like reading epics. All in all a good FYS.","Best classic professor I've had yet. Has a voice like a radio announcer.

She specializes in historiography, so you will come out of the course knowing more about Greek historians and the practice of writing history in the ancient world than you ever would have expected. As far as the material itself, it is difficult Greek, but Dr. Baragwanath knows what she is doing and helps you.","Baragwanath knows her stuff. The class is really text-based, and her lectures always expound on the topic in the readings, so you actually have to read.

I had no interest in Classics before taking this class, but learned more than I ever thought I would about Western history, art, philosophy and morality.","Hilariously difficult, patronizing, and humiliating. Her criticism is so unnecessarily rude that her point often gets lost. My class was only a first-year seminar, but it's been my hardest this semester. Unless you're very, very serious about learning Classics, avoid this professor. Not worth your time.","I had no interest in this subject before I took this class and was really dreading it, but she made it incredibly interesting, one of the best classes I've taken at UNC.

As long as you show up the pop quizzes are a breeze.. reading quizzes usually have answers online. For tests just give him what he (or the TA's) want to hear","He's a really good teacher. His class is engaging and it really makes you think in different ways about myth. The papers are kind of difficult, but 35% of your grade comes from easy open book quizzes and in class pop quizzes, so it is very possible to make an A- or even an A. Overall he's a really awesome professor who tries to help his students.","I loved Professor Rives! he is super nice, and a great lecturer. Genius about his subject, but not arrogant in the slightest. Really wants to know his students; he tried his best to learn people's names in a class with 50 or so people. I feel like I could go to him for anything.","Very passionate professor who is dedicated to helping his students. There is a lot of reading (primary sources, no textbook), but that's to be expected in a mythology class. Not the easiest class I've taken (more difficult than expected for a 100-level course) and TAs grade really hard, but it's definitely interesting material.","Rives is a GREAT professor. He is engaging and funny and I thoroughly enjoy his lectures. I am a math major, so Classics is out of my expertise but I have an A- in the class now (and I haven't done the reading). 35% of your grade comes from open note/book quizzes. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend his CLAS 131 class. I hope to take another class with him","Rives is really interesting and I liked the class, but there's a LOT of reading and he grades really hard. No matter how well I knew the material I got the same grade. You have to go to class because there are 15 pop quizzes and you can only miss one.","James Rives makes mythology interesting during lecture. He seems to enjoy interpreting the works in the terms of college students instead of that of a college professor. There is a lot of reading, which is very easy to get behind on. There are many reading quizzes and pop quizzes, so go to class all the time.","JAmes Rives is a fabulous professor! He keeps everything interesting in Mythology. There is a lot of reading which you shouldn't let yourself fall behind on. Make sure you do your reading quizzes and go to class for the pop quizzes! HIGHLY recommended.","Professor Rives was honestly one of the best instructors I have ever had. The class requires alot of reading which you must do to succeed in the class, however most of them are poems and novels, and he reviews them well in the lecture. Attendance is not mandatory, but he delivers a series of pop quizzes which will count against you. Also his the tw","prof rives is always excited about CLASSICS!!!  i didnt have any interest in classics, but i feel like he makes an effort to have interesting class discussions.  fun man and he bought us pizza"],"courses":["CLAS131","CLAS131","CLAS131","CLAS131","CLAS131","CLAS151","CLAS131","CLAS131","CLAS131","CLASS063"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
