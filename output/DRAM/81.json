I never thought I would enjoy a drama class but we read so many different plays I had never heard of that I thoroughly loved. He's funny and tries really hard to make everything relatable. I really like his interpretation and analysis of each and every play and how he connects it to contemporary culture. Take him!","Kable is quite a character (in a good way)! Never thought I would enjoy a drama class, but the plays we read actually aren't bad at all. If you go to lecture and actually jot down what he's saying (and do other crap the entire time) you'll ace the tests. It's all pretty straightforward and Kable is a fun guy.","Okay so Drama 115 should be an easy A right? Not with this professor. I made a B- with a lot of effort as compared to friends with no work and A's with another professor. The tests are half true and false, which are extremely easy to confuse so don't think of true and false as something easy. He talks the entire hour with slides with literally pics","Loved Greg! He's hilarious in an eccentric way. The assignment descriptions are not entirely clear, but as long as you put in a visible amount of work, he'll appreciate your effort. Definitely recommend for anyone, not just people interested in drama!","very eccentric, love him to death. took DRAM81H, was super fun and an easy A! highly recommend","Prof. Kable makes his lectures fun.  I had him for DRAM 292: The American Musical.  His lectures are full of comedy and videos that explain exactly what he is talking about.  While his grading rubrics are always the clearest, if you need help, it's definitely there.  Attendance policy is very strict.  GO TO CLASS!!!","Professor Kable clearly loves Drama, and this drama class is really fun and gets rid of a lot of GENEDS.  Its not too hard at all, and his grading criteria for essays is always very specific so you know what to do to get a good grade.  Definitely recommend this seminar.","My 2nd class with Kable. I love him- favorite professor here. Makes my day bright with clips from Lady Gaga concert footage, Mean Girls, Glee, and Pitch Perfect.","This class is completely doable.  Kable makes the subject interesting and when I took this class last spring it was easy to do well if you did the assigned readings and came to class.  The paper is daunting at first, but it really isn't that bad once you get started.  Would definitely recommend!","Take this class with this professor! He is absolutely great! Makes a dull non-major subject very interesting. I was dreading this course when I enrolled but it is definitely one of my favorite classes that I have taken. Kable is the man!","His personality will strike you, he's funny and witty although he won't look like it at first glance. Very passionate about theatre and is enthused with class participation. Test we multiple choice and true/false so they could be tricky, but they were generally easy if you pay attention to lecture","Great professor! No homework outside of a few papers/group project. Not a lot of work and an easy grader. Class is mandatory (with the exception of a few absences he'll excuse) but reading is not mandatory. As long as you read up on sparknotes before class you can generally be fine in the class discussions which are voluntary to speak in.","Funny and clever but lectures are often monotonous, tests are confusing.","A really fascinating lecturer but his tests are confusing and difficult.","He was one of my favorite teachers. such a great class to go to.","This class was pretty easy. Kable's lectures aren't that boring, considering that it's drama. If you take good notes and are good at memorization, you'll be fine.","Prof. Kable is great! He's a really nice guy, and is very passionate about theatre.  He relates all of the plays to today by comparing them with movies and TV shows today.  There are four essays a semester, including the final exam.  There is almost never any homework besides reading plays.","Professor Kable is passionate about what he teaches and makes classes interesting. Makes drama enjoyable even to those who are not interested in the arts","I love Greg. He's interesting and knowledgeable and it's obvious that he cares about teaching. Make sure you know the information on the study sheets and you'll be golden on tests. Attendance isn't mandatory, but class is always interesting; he shows film clips every day and often gives extra credit.","The A was much harder to get than it should've been with my prior knowledge because TAs arbitrarily grade papers (mine had only a 3 word comment) and test questions can be ambiguous even with studying. Still, it's a fun class with an entertaining professor. Start the paper early and come every day in case he gives EC (esp days right after tests)."],"courses":["DRAM285H","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM81H","DRAM81H","DRAM292","DRAM81H","282","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAM120","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAMA115","DRAMA115","DRAM81","DRAM115","DRAM115","DRAM115"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
