He loves what he's teaching, and he knows so much about it, especially considering most of the topics were pretty out there. A ten page paper for the midterm and the final, a couple of opinion-based short essays, and that's pretty much it. Easy A, and cool class.","Marr's the man. Take this class","Very interesting professor.  Leads thought-provoking discussions and helps you to think on a higher plane.  Very available to discuss projects and willing to give helpful feedback.  Interested in students.  Most of grade is based on two main papers, which can seem daunting, but he helps and guides you as you work on each for half of the semester.","Professor Marr is probably the best professor I've had. He's extremely enthusiastic about the material, an animated, engaging lecturer, and thoroughly smart and articulate. He is heavily invested in his students--he took the time to learn all 60+ names and faces. Not an easy A: the average student is just  much smarter than the majority.","Professor Marr was an awesome guy, and he was extremely knowledgeable about his subject matter. I had such little interest in this class, and yeah, it was kinda boring for me, but professor Marr makes it so much more fun and is great at getting to know you and being a personal guy. I highly recommend this teacher.","Dr. Marr is brilliant passionate about both his subject and his students. I loved going to the lectures each week. The class is a bit disorganized, but I would highly recommend a class with Marr. His lectures broadened my perspective on American culture and history, and always left me wanting to talk about class material with friends.","TIM MARR IS THE BEST. He is very passionate about what he teaches and gives great feedback! He enjoys seeing all sides of topics and drawing them our so you can easily grasp them. I have no doubt that this class completely changed my way of thinking about everything. It was hard to adjust to the work load, but it was totally worth it! I loved it!","Dr. Marr is a genius  AND an amazing teacher. best class ever.","Very passionate and engaging.  Professor Marr made sure his classes were thought provoking and interesting.  Absolutely loved this class.  There are two major projects, both papers, and a lot of individual reading assignments.  But they are all interesting.  I recommend this seminar to anyone and everyone.","Genius. His class on Herman Melville changed how I approach literature.","MY FAVORITE teacher at UNC! Sooo interested in his subject matter and helping his students! A MUST for any Amst major especially!","Prof. Marr is very passionate about what he teaches.  He inspired us to do our best work.   There was alot of reading and writing, but you should take this class if issues of birth and death interest you.  Work consists of two major projects (papers), one on birth one on death.  I learned things unknown to me prior to class.","Professor Marr is a bit kooky, but very passionate about what he teaches and very good at engaging the class.  The work load for this class was moderate but always interesting.  You will excel in his class as long as you put forth effort and enthusiasm."],"courses":["AMST55","AMST055H","AMST55","AMST384","AMST384","AMST384","AMST55H","AMST55H","AMST055H","AMST256","AMST269","AMST055H","AMST061"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
