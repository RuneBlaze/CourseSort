Lectures aren't mandatory and all material comes from slides, which he posts online. No point attending class if you don't want to. HW can be done as a group. Tests are really easy (my ECON 101 class was 3 times as hard!) He's pretty funny and a good lecturer.  Microeconomics need not be daunting with Ackermann. Recommended!19940","Jeff is a super nice guy and his lectures (that you definitely don't have to attend) are funny. However, his tests are not written by him so they don't relate well to what he lectures on in class. It should all be super easy, but I was definitely caught off guard with a horrible final that ruined my grade. Glad it's over.","His class seems easy until you have a test. He doesn't writes his own homework or tests so they don't correspond to his lectures very well. Also, a lot of times he doesn't really know what he's talking about. He's funny so his lectures aren't too boring and there's not much work outside of class but the tests took me off guard.","This is a tough class mostly because the professor doesn't know what he's talking about. He is good at teaching the specific material, but he lacks basic knowledge of topics taught in ECON 101."],"courses":["ECON310","ECON310","ECON310","ECON310"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
