However, with assignments there were no clear guidelines given, the grading seemed ambiguous and subjective without any explanation. Grades are not posted/made available until the end of the semester.","If you have the chance to take this class, please do it. This is one of my favorite classes and I learned so much new material in so many different ways. Each professor provided insight into some specific topic and opened up my perspectives to a much larger scale. Loved trips to shows and art museums as well. Take this class if you can!","This class consisted of different guess lectures, some were good and some weren't. He is a really good professor and cool guy. Gives extra credit and is willing to help you.","I was disappointed that the whole semester was taught by guest speakers; I wanted to listen on Dr. Taj's lectures. But if you have basic knowledge of Asia, this class will be a breeze. Assignments consist of journal entries and one (6pg) paper. Recommend seeing the movies, I really enjoyed them.","He doesn't lecture. He gets other people to do it for him. He has the best gig of any professor.","A bit disorganized; knowledgable feller","Great teacher. Take Indian film and novel if you can, it fulfills lots of requirements and is a very interesting/easy class."],"courses":["ASIA59","ASIA150","ASIA150","ASIA150","150","ASIA150","ASIA162"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
