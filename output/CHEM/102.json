If you go to lecture, office hours, and do all the assigned work you will be fine! I studied all the time for this class, and the tests were still extremely difficult for me. You have to learn how to do the problems quickly. I loved the mentor review sessions as well. I loved this class, and I'm sure you all will too!","Professor Bliem is a good person to take 101 or 102 with. The tests are difficult, but she gives you plenty of practice problems to work in class and out of class that are very beneficial. She's pretty cool too, so that helps","Bliem is a charismatic professor. I looked forward to her lectures, but I may be biased since I enjoy chemistry. She has a great sense of humor that she shows often, and her daily homework and quizzes are great learning aids. They're not busy work, and they help the material stay fresh in your mind.","One of the most enthusiastic professor's I've had. This is not an easy class but if you put in the work you'll get a high grade. She has tons of resources for you and if you really try in the class you will get a good grade.","I personally think Professor Bliem is one of the best Chem professors at UNC. She does had a flipped classroom, which means you will have to get familiar with the material before coming to class. However, I think this is a very effective method. During class, she does a lot of practice problems and goes in depth for the important topics.","Bliem is an absolute terrible Chem 101 teacher. Over 40% of my class failed, and the averages for tests were all below 60. There were no curves, no extra credit, and Bliem sometimes stood me up at office hours. She does not respond to email. There is a daily quiz in class, along with homework every night. Boring lecturer. Avoid at all cost please!","Clear lectures and homework, but tests are much more difficult than any other assigned material.  Office hours and homework are a must.  She is very helpful during her office hours, and they are often even more beneficial than the class.  Read the textbook and do the recommended problems.  Fair grader and wonderful teacher, but tests are difficult.","It is totally possible to do well in Bliem's class, but you have to do your readings, homework, and come to class. Her tests are tough, but make you think critically about chemistry. Taking her again for 102 next semester. Avoid is you aren't willing to put in the work to get an A.","Bliem is a super cool person, but she's not the best teacher around. I never went to class, but to get daily points you have to go to class... so go to class. You have homework every day, and she reads straight off the powerpoint during lectures. Her tests are insanely hard, but if you study for two weeks beforehand, you'll be okay. Not the worst","Professor Bliem has a flipped class, but she gives COUNTLESS resources to help. Office hours, extra recommended problems and helpful videos are abundant. FREE ONLINE TEXTBOOK! Homework is minimal, but VERY helpful. I spent 10-45 min MAX on homework. Attendance is mandatory and she has in class quizzes each day (3 ?'s each). Best CHEM101 class.","One of those 'wake up and welcome to college' professors. If you don't take the class seriously, your grade will reflect it. Go into every mid-term prepared and armed to the teeth with every single thing that has been mentioned in lecture and in the readings. Sapling and recommended problems help learning content as well. Don't be afraid to ask.","She's a nice lady but a terrible teacher. If you do not do well in the flipped classroom style of learning, meaning you cannot teach yourself well, do not take her class. Most of what you learn is from teaching yourself problems and homework she assigns outside of class. Her tests are much more difficult than anything she ever teaches in class.","Professor Bliem was very nice, but I felt very confused by a lot of her explanations, and she had a tendency to introduce concepts on the warmup quiz using the exceptions to the concepts; sound confusing? It was. The tests required a fair amount of studying, but sometimes the study materials provided did not align well with the test material.","Dr. Bliem's tests were quite difficult, all free response, but overall fair, just gotta work for it. Her lectures can be a little unorganized and doesn't really follow the textbook, though she doesn't explain things well. Problem sets are hard, but good practice for the exams. Not a lot of practice for exams. Did curve the class to 85  A though.","Professor Bliem is super nice and tries to help you, but it doesn't always work out. She gives you daily homework and assigns practice problems, which you should definitely; however, her tests are ten times harder than the homework she gives, so be prepared for that. I went to her office hours and did all the practice problems and wasn't successful","The averages for her 101 class for the second and third tests were a 68 (after a 10 point curve) and a 62. Expect to work if chemistry doesn't come naturally to you. She is nice but not super helpful","Prof. B is awesome. If you go to her for help she will help you for sure. Like other chem classes, practice problems are a must. But if you don't plan on doing practice problems all of your life, go to mentor review session because they go over problems, sometimes problems from previous exams. Online homework also helps a ton, so take it seriously.","Personally I thought she was a boring lecturer. Tests are more concept based unlike Professor Benton. Look to the mentors for help as Dr. Bliem can't and won't help all the hundreds of students she has.","The class requires some work, but it's not impossible. There is \"daily work\" you have to do before class everyday, like online warm ups, and there are clickers, so you have to go to class. Most of your grade is determined by the tests. You should go to at least a few TA review sessions because they offer helpful tips and tricks to make life easier.","Bliem was great this semester, although I do believe her teaching style isn't for everyone. You definitely have to learn things on your own, but she gives you the resources to do that.  If thats not for you, Benton is the way to go!

Compared to many professors who ramble/ stutter, his lectures are extremely organized and coherent. Offers many opportunities to get help outside of class. Exams are hard, but fair (similar to difficult HW problems). Rumored to make people cry, but in reality doesn't seem to be all that bad if you show up prepared.","Dr. Tiani is a great lecturer. His tests (hard) are written on specifically what he talks about in class; the more math heavy questions are from the homework. You really have to \"understand the chemistry\" when taking this class with him. Be strong and study hard; he can be hard on you if you let him-don't let him. He wants you to learn. Final hard","Great professor.  He expects his students to be mature and accountable for their own learning.  Do exactly what he recommends to prepare for tests.  Do the practice problems and come to class.  If you do these things you will find that his tests are very fair.  He really wants everyone to do well.  He is the professor to take for analytical chem.","One of the most difficult courses I've taken at UNC. Extremely tough grader, can be kind of rude to students, made me cry once in office hours.","He explains concepts clearly and is upfront with what he expects of the class. Do your work and you'll be fine.","Great lecturer presents topics very clearly and efficiently. He doesn't mess around in class which was good for someone like me. He gives lots of required homework and some optional problems. If you do all the problems he gives you you should be fine. he is a little unapproachable","To give him credit, Professor Tiani knows gen Chem topics and is solid at teaching them in lectures. Besides that, he is an abysmal professor. Completely unapproachable and rude. Every time he talks to the student its like he's getting in a the ring with them, trying to knock them down with insults and ruin their day.","Everyone told me I would hate Tiani and to switch out but honestly I loved being in his class. His lectures are amazing and yes his personality is a little rough around the edges but he does care for students and cracks a few jokes every now and then. This class isn't for everyone but I do recommend him as a professor.","I really hated this class. He made the concepts sound easy in lecture but then tested us on incredibly difficult problems. I would not recommend him at all.","He is not easily to approach but really does want you to do well. He just makes you work for it more then others.","I had to switch to regular 241 not bc material was hard but bc of his condescending attitude. Also he's needlessly strict about certain things that are a waste of time. For ex, my calculator solves quadratics. He said on an exam Id have to do it by hand to get credit, implying anything else was lazy. Nvm, doing it by hand leads to more errors.","Definitely a hard class but he gives you a lot of opportunity for help. Very condescending, but helpful nonetheless. Tests are hard but doable if you read and do practice problems.","He can be mean sometimes. Make sure not to ask stupid questions. The lab was really tiring. He uses clickers for the lecture quizzes.","He has way too high expectations for a general chemistry class. You have to put in a lot of work to read and do all the online homework. But he's a great lecturer, and I really understood the material just by attending class. I would only recommend him if you want to put in the work to really understand chemistry. If not, then stay away!","Tests weren't too bad for me.","Went in for help and he literally gave me a lecture on how I shouldn't be in his class.","Dr. Tiani is a pretty good lecturer teacher, but beware of office hours.  He is super condescending when you ask questions and makes you feel pretty stupid, even though in lectures he encourages students to stop by. There are also way too many online assignments.  Overall though, if you go to lectures and do the work, you should be fine.","Here's the truth: Tiani is a great lecturer, but everything he teaches can be learned from all of the online homework he gives you. The tests are simple (not easy) but tricky. There's more work than is necessary, and he can be condescending during office hours. Don't take him if you don't have to, but don't lament if you do. It won't be too bad.","HE'S SUCH AN JERK. NEVER ASK HIM A QUESTION. GOD. HE REALLY NEEDS TO RELAX AND BE LESS RUDE TO STUDENTS.","Lecture was interesting, tests were tricky and not easy. If you ask for help, he'll rant about how he already talked about it in class, berate you, and then go over everything.

While you don't work with her directly, you will have a TA who you're with all semester who you either will be lucky or unlucky with. Prepare to spend at least 20 hours a week either in lab, on prelabs, or on lab reports, only to barely pass the class. Terrible experience.","Lori is the most unorganized professor I've ever worked with. She coordinates all of 101 and 102 labs, and it seems she writes most of the labs in the manual. The manual and the lab report instructions are extremely ambiguous, and you're forever guessing on what they expect. If you're lucky, you get an awesome TA who lets you ask hella questions.","Lori is the worst. She designed the entire course and none of the experiments actually worked. The TAs were a nightmare and the grading criteria was ridiculous. The prelabs took forever and the lab reports were even longer. Get ready to pour hours of your time into these assignments and get a 65 for significant figures. Quizzes were impossible.","Depending on the TA, the class can be extremely difficult. Grading standards vary based on TA's and they don't follow the rubrics when grading lab reports. It is almost impossible to get an A.","She is the director of all the Chem 101 labs, but you will not work directly with Dr. Del Negro. Instead, you will regularly work with your TA during lab.
