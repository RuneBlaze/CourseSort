Truly cares about his students. If you do the work and don't get behind on the readings, it's easy to do well. Also, his lectures are hilariousssss! and when I came a few minutes late to an exam one day and there were no more seats, he let me sit in the front so I'll have a desk. You can tell he truly cares about his students.","Fantastic lecturer. Anatomy is a lot of dense material but he explains it clearly. Also, Johnson records his lectures which is clutch af when studying. Be sure to get the poll everywhere question right! Correct answers give an extra bonus point. The tests are tough but they are completely fair and straight forward. TAKE HIM","Challenging class.  Soooooo much material, but you'll thank him later. Really great lectures.  There's some of the talk-to-your-neighbor BS like other bio classes but not too much.  This course helped me learn to READ, and I'm thankful for it.","Good lecturer","I would recommend him to anyone who is taking Anatomy and Physiology. It is definitely not a class you can easily pass by studying the day before. His exams are difficult but fair. Most of the exam questions are straight forward and some are tricky. Lab is a hard, so be careful and study a lot. He's such a cute and nice person.","Great lecturer.  The bio dept. needs more like him.  Tests were tricky, but very fair.  Purchase the bigger textbook.  The condensed one does not cover some of his lecture material.  That way, if you miss something from lecture, you can get it from the book.  Super approachable and caring; never felt rushed out the door in office hours.","Class uses both textbook and his lectures. There is a ton of information to learn but he does his best to make it fair albeit difficult. The first test was the easiest so don't slack especially on tests 2 and 3. He is engaging and committed to the class.","A pretty clear lecturer but boring. He's monotone and will throw around some jokes, but I honestly couldn't pay attention in class. Watch out cause his tests are tricky. Sometimes he takes more questions from the book info and sometimes more from his lectures/ppts. Nice guy and if you argue back for test points, he'll most likely give you one.","Awesome professor. As he says \"Just know everything and you will be fine\". Biol 252 is a had class, but if I would have to take it all over again, I would take it with him. I would take any possible class with him, loved him. He is a great teacher!","Professor Johnson is the best professor I have ever had. Take any and all courses you can with him. Heck, if he was teaching Intro to Women's Studies or History of Medieval Europe I would take that class. The subject matter is difficult for A&P, but he makes it interesting. The assignments are easy. The multiple-choice exams are not. Study a lot.","ONE OF MY FAVORITE PROFESSORS! Anatomy and Physiology is a lot of work! but his powerpoints are great! He always seems to cover everything you need to know without rushing. you have to do your part (study his ppts), but you can't claim your failure on him.","Love Dr. Johnson (so cute), but this class is hard. My advice - write down every single thing he says in class and study like crazy. Tests are fair but hard. He is great with email so def email him with questions (I did all the time). Lab is a pain b/c he writes the exams now, not the TAs, so lab is not as easy. Book is not really needed.","GREAT TEACHER!  Take him for A&P if you have the opportunity!!","I love Dr. Johnson! Probably the best professor I had at UNC.","By far the best professor I've had. Tells you exactly what will be on the exam (what's on the outlines). The book he chose is very good. Only tests you on material you go over in class although you need to know more details on those topics. Also very nice person who will be glad to help you with any problems.","Dr. Johnson is a sweet man & a good professor. He e-mails back very fast & is willing to meet with you/hold exam study sessions. BIOL in general is hard but straightforward so if you don't do well it's not his fault. His tests are completely reasonable & he makes little jokes in class. He also sometimes mentions his new daughter which is adorable.","Dr. Johnson is the best! He is readily available for office hours and his lecture notes are clear and concise. While I recommend that you read the textbook (it's helpful), you don't have to, since he only tests things that he covered in class. Plus, he is incredibly cute and fun to listen to!","I love Dr. Johnson!! :) Amazing professor. The class was at 8am but definitely worth coming to. Exams weren't too bad pretty straight forward but theres a ****ton of material, but thats for any class. Would definitely take him again for other bio classes.","Very nice guy. Extremely helpful and cares a lot about his student. Not an easy class...lots of memorizations but you bust you butt and you'll do well ;) Plus he gives you a chance to make up for you lowest grade if you improve well enough.","Great Professor. Unlike most bio profs he cares about his students. Funny, helpful, and makes class enjoyable. Outline notes are posted before lecture, which helps when the lecture material gets dull. Tests are fill in the blank & T/F, but he makes it clear what will and will not be on the test."],"courses":["BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIO252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL252","ANAT252","BIOL252","BIOL252","BIOL276","BIOL252","BIOL276"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"BIOL","catalog_nbr":291,"section":8,"class_nbr":12572,"title":"TEACHING APPRENTICE IN BIOLOGYLecture","component":"1","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"HOGAN,KELLY A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":20,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=451397","fname":"Kelly","lname":"Hogan","quality":"3.7","easiness":"3.9","help":"3.9","clarity":"3.9","topTag":"Tough Grader (22)","grade":"3.9","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER","TOUGH GRADER","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","LECTURE HEAVY","PARTICIPATION MATTERS","AMAZING LECTURES","RESPECTED","LOTS OF HOMEWORK","RESPECTED","SKIP CLASS?

Lots of application questions and the homework/GRQ (guided reading questions) and notes are pretty time consuming. You will learn a lot, but theres a good amount of work.","Dr. Hogan was an excellent teacher. I loved her as a person and how she was able to keep Biology exciting and fun. She made the class of over 400 people seem so much smaller by her teaching style. I didn't do very well in her class, unfortunately, because the exams are quite difficult. I would highly recommend this professor though!","Dr. Hogan was one of my favorite professors. She is a great teacher,  and although her tests are difficult, if you study hard you can do well. One thing I loved is that she often reminded us that grades don't define us and that there's more to life that school.","Awesome professor, but a challenging class nonetheless. Expect a lot of questions that require you to think abstractly and demonstrate mastery.","Dr. Hogan is a great lecturer and really cares to help her students.  Some exams may be tough, and online homework was annoying sometimes, but not too difficult and does help to understand the material.  Just attend class and you will do fine.","Dr. Hogan is super sweet and gives you all the resources she can to help you succeed. Lectures are interesting and she dumbs down the material in class to make sure everyone understands it. However, her tests are much much much more difficult than lectures make you think they will be. Overall, it was a good experience and I learned a lot.","TAKE HOGAN! Lectures are engaging. She's lowkey funny and super chill. Keep up with the readings, its a decent amount, but nothing crazy. There are learning catalytics questions daily for a participation grade. The class moves at a good pace. Tests aren't \"easy\", but if you do the work, you'll be fine. 10/10 would recommend!","Her format for teaching is incredible, and she really gives you all the tools you need to do well. Be prepared to do a lot on your own time, but a great class and professor.","Hogan is an amazing teacher. She is so passionate about science which makes a difficult subject enjoyable. Her lectures are very interesting and engaging. Her tests are very tough, but if you can devote a couple days to studying and keep up with notes and actually read the text you'll do fine. This class really taught me how to study the right way.","Kelly Hogan is outstanding! Her lectures are goal-oriented and in-depth. She deeply cares about her students and the material, listening to feedback and thoroughly reviewing confusing material. Her first two tests were okay, but the third one was difficult for the whole class. The final is rewarding if you keep up with the class.","Hogan is a phenomenal professor. I walked into this class extremely intimated and rightfully so. Hogan will help you no matter what - she is sweet and considerate and so passionate about biology. She really makes you work for your grade, but her class teaches you how to learn and how to study. I would definitely take her again. She's an inspiration","Dr. Hogan makes topics very interesting, she takes times with difficult subjects, she addresses concerns in class, and is very clear. Her tests are VERY hard but you actually learn instead of memorize it, a lot of work is required for this course but i would highly recommend her. She cares about you learning the material.","Dr. Hogan was an amazing professor for Biol 101. She gives adequate time on difficult biology matters and makes sure that she gets through everything she had planned on in the lecture. You have online mastering due twice a week, which some can take 30 minutes, others can take 2 hours. Over all, do the mastering and pay attention and come to class!","Honestly this class was hard if you never took AP Bio. This is where you learn if you were meant to be in the science field or not. She's a great person though! Definitely cares about her students.","As long as you go to class everyday, do all of your online assignments, and go to SI at least once a week you'll definitely get at least a C easily. B if you read your textbook.","Hogan is awesome! She's really nice and is a good resource not only for the biology department but for helping first-years get acquainted to UNC in general. The tests are SUPER hard and cover a lot of material. Make sure you stay on top of all the GRQs and homework so you can do well on the exams. There's 4 exams and she drops the lowest grade.","Hogan assigns a lot of work, but it pays off. It's a little annoying to have to participate so much in a big lecture class where you might rather just sit back and listen, but all of the things she makes you do for participation grade end up really helping you learn. She thinks a lot about how her students will learn best.","Hogan is a great professor assuming your comfortable doing the majority of work outside of class. Lectures are very helpful and extremely engaging. Hogan does her best in making herself available to such a large class.","She's really nice and funny. The lectures are pretty fun. You use your laptop to answer questions during class.","By far my favorite professor at UNC so far.  I was interested in biology already, but she made it very fun, interactive and I actually wanted to do the homework.  She truly cares about her students; when I got an A on a test, she personally emailed me to congratulate and keep up the good work.

I was shocked by how difficult biology became, since I always made A's in every biology class I took in high school. Go to the lectures for online participation but don't expect to better understand material. She makes class content confusing and doesn't offer much help for students.","I like Dr. Evans but I hated having her in class. She treated us like we were children, and the videos we watched were not very helpful. My main problem with her was the fact that she was very rude during office hours. She made me feel like I was wasting her time by being there. Also she loves trick questions, so watch out.","Evans didn't her use her time wisely in class. She made the class watch videos that just made the content even more confusing. It is a very flipped classroom and tests are difficult, however... she lets you drop your lowest exam grade which is nice. If you want to do well in this class, you must work for it.","She can hold a laser pointer extremely steady, it's actually quite uncanny","Dr. Evans was not a very good lecturer, in fact she didn't really lecture at all. She asks you questions to discuss with your neighbor, but then she never tells you the correct answers to the questions. I found her annoying and not very helpful.","great professor but she makes you learn it through in class discussion and activities","I don't know what the other ratings on here are talking about because I loved Dr. Evans. As a junior I have taken a multitude of other biology classes and found Dr. Evans to be one of the most helpful & clear professors. With participation in lecture I needed minimal work outside the class to secure an A. LOVED her so ignore other posts & take her","This class is easy. If you know the basics of biology its pretty much an easy A. You don't need the test book at all or need to show up to class. I skipped class over ten times and still have an A in the course. The only difficult part is maybe the first section but as long as you show up to the SI session you will get all the material need.","All of her tests except for the first one are easy. At the end of the Semester I did not show up to class for over a month and still have a high A going into the final. Dr. Evans however is not a very good teacher, she is terrible at explaining things and spends all of her class time focusing on topics not relevant to the tests. Would not recommend","She doesn't teach. Be prepared to \"turn to the person next to you to discuss\" during the lecture. But good luck because they probably don't know what's going on either!","Hour&15 minute long lectures are usually based on \"group\" discussion of a worksheet of questions that could be answered individually in less than 15 minutes. Often gives incorrect information during class, asks test questions that are purposely misleading. Make sure you DO overthink test questions, the answer is often not what seems most logical.","I really enjoyed this class. The lectures are usually pretty fun even if you have to learn outside the class by doing the homework. The first unit is A LOT harder than the others, so don't be daunted. The first unit has a lot more homework and a harder test. After that, though, most of the class is very basic vocabulary and pretty logical.","Doesn't teach. There are times where she doesn't know what she's talking about and can't help solve problems because she can't do them herself.","Live by the text book and you still won't succeed. Ask her questions and she will just read off of her notes again.","Dr. Evans is not a good teacher. She spends too much time on irrelevant things during lecture when we could have gone over important material from the tests. She asks a lot of questions that no one knows the answer to. Tests are nothing like the material she goes over in class. Very difficult.","Dr. Evans is enthusiastic and caring, but I would HIGHLY recommend taking Hogan instead. Dr. Evans is still new to teaching, and it shows. There were questions on exams that had NO RIGHT ANSWER. The lectures are all about trying to learn from classmates who also don't know anything. If you can teach yourself and go to SI, you'll be alright though.","Go to office hours!","I basically used the textbook to teach myself, and lectures were nothing but working with the people around you and you never got the correct answers to questions. 12","Dr. Evans doesn't lecture. She wants you to work with the people around you to learn and doesn't always give the correct answers to her guided notes/outlines for the powerpoints.","Took this class as a prereq for pre-med, she's a really nice person and loved meeting her! It was her first year teaching and I studied a lot for this class so I did well, but I know that some people didn't really like her. If you take notes on your own and go to class you will be fine.

I remember many people saying that this was the professor that they had ever had, and now, I think the same thing. However, don't underestimate the work load. Anatomy in general is tough, but you are still expected to know just as much as any other course.","Great lecturer, who knows his stuff. If you're fascinated by the human body, this class will give you the satisfaction of deeply exploring its marvels. I must say that since 92% of your overall grade is test average, the pressure to perform is always there... which amounts to many hours of studying notes and textbook material.","Dr. Shemer is a genius and makes class really interesting. The tests are fair for what is covered in lecture, but sometimes the multiple choice is tricky","Great teacher! Shemer is very knowledgeable about biology and answers any questions you have really well or to the best of his ability. He assigns just the few pages of reading that you need and goes over topics in detail during class so everything that will be on the test will be explained in person. Take lots of notes during lecture.","Dr. Shemer is the best professor I've encountered in the biology department. His lectures are clear and well organized, he's interactive with the class, and takes questions often and seems to really care if we understand the material.  He gives a lot of practice for the tests and his review sessions are super helpful.","Shemer is one of the most intelligent lecturers I have ever had. He makes attending lecture interesting and worth my while. There is a TON of material, but that is with the nature of the class. He also only has two exams, and then the final, so there is more pressure on those two classes. You really cannot find a better professor for the material.","The class is hard, but very fair. Shemer is a great teacher and gives lots of resources for extra help. If you study the material along the way and don't wait until the weekend before the test, you'll be fine. Lab is worth a big part of your grade, so study hard for that too and you'll be fine","Great professor. Very funny, loves what he teaches, crystal clear. His exams are not bad, makes you think and apply your knowledge, if you study his notes and understand the material well, you'll be fine","Passionate, interesting, knowledgeable, and humorous.  His exam are fair but challenging.  I highly recommend him for A&P.","He is fabulous. hard and expects a lot from his students but truly one of the best at UNC. He is a must!","Shemer is passionate about what he teaches and truly tries to integrate the entire class in his lectures. But his tests are very unfair. I studied for weeks before and still did badly on them. He even said in class \"I know that some of you are studying a lot and still doing bad. Don't be discouraged.\" Great, but my Gpa is messed up bc of this! :/","He is very funny and a nice guy! His lectures are interesting, but his tests are the hardest tests I have ever taken. I would put in over 20 hours studying and just do decent on the test. Also you HAVE to go to class. He tests you on stuff that he just says in class and is not in the book or on powerpoints.","Very difficult class, especially for someone who is not interested in science. However, I absolutely loved this class. I enjoyed going every day. His tests are very hard, but he's also clear on what to expect. Study hard and often, and enjoy his funny lectures!","Anatomy with Shemer was one of my favorite classes at UNC. It was entertaining, interesting, & funny & he was always available in office hours. Exams were challenging but it was clear what to expect; they were multiple choice, t/f, & fill-in-the-blank, requiring higher-level thinking. He scheduled exams so they wouldn?t conflict with lab exams.","An all around good fellow. He has high expectations not for the purpose of maintaining a curve, but because he is genuinely concerned if you do well.","He is INCREDIBLE!  He is so interested in the subject matter and he brings a lot of energy to the class, so lectures are a lot of fun.  He talks quickly, so I would recommend a recorder.  He also offers extra credit for a few people if they want to write a song about anatomy and perform it!  He is always willing to give additional explanations.","Prof. Shemer is one of the best professors I've ever had.  Although the course isn't easy due to the breath of material covered, Shemer is very clear in explaining what you need to know.  He's entertaining, keeps the class engaged and his powerpoints are very helpful.  Definitely recommend this class!

Just make sure you the information like the back of your hand. Would definitely suggest this class.","Awesome teacher! Difficult material, but what else would you expect with the human body. His speech is hard to understand at times but he does all he can to help you out. Overall this was one of my favorite classes at UNC.","Loved him!  No curve though.

But she still tests you on info from that outline that she didn't even cover. Nice lady but difficult exams and info not presented well","Doesn't finish the lectures or outlines and you are often left having to learn the material for a test without having gone over it in class.","Avoid taking her. Lectures are boring and monotonous. Power points aren't really organized. On her second test she asked loads of questions about the material she barely went over in class. Very bad when it comes to responding the emails. TAs do all the work. Recitations are a total waste of your life.","She sounded kind of out of breath a lot of the times, but she's really not bad.  Definitely a very smart woman and not bad at communicating the ideas she wants you to understand.","She gives you outlines before class so all you have to do is write down minimal notes in class.  The tests weren't really that hard and the material was actually pretty interesting.  The recitation is a little to much work though.","Reasonably good professor but boring and slow-moving at times. Gives relatively easy tests, but requires attendance and participation in recitation, unlike most Bio classes. She also requires a 4-page paper that's just a giant hassle."],"courses":["BIO201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIO201","BIOL201","BIOL54","BIOL54"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
