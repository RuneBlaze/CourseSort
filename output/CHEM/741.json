He's incredibly smart, but not intimidating, which is rare. Tests are the only grades, so be ready to study. He spends a few classes at the end of the year talking about his research, and that alone is worth the extra work of the honors class. He's the bomb","Go to class (which he cancels often). Its only a 2 unit course, so there's not much material compared to other chems. I took it with the lab and the work load wasn't bad. There are no assignments due, just tests. Due the suggested HW, similar to exams. No attendance taken, but go to class because not everything covered is in his power points.","If you have the chance to take his first year seminar, take it. He is a cool guy that likes to get to know his students on a personal level. He grades fairly and wants his students to succeed at UNC and in life.","Solid professor. Goes through the material rather quickly, but has Q/A sessions after class to clear things up. Tests were very fair. Questions came right from the practice problems most of the time. Overall, cool guy, willing to help. Took 241 over the summer (recommend), but be prepared for a load if also taking 241L at the same time.","Teaches extremely fast. 1/3 of classes are cancelled so material is crammed in. Material is sometimes boring but he throws in lots of jokes to mix it up. Grading policy is very fair, enables you to mess up. He's REALLY good if you ask questions outside of class, very nice guy and super helpful. He wants you to understand the material. Tests so-so.","He's really horrible at lecturing and if book-learning chemistry isn't your forte, stay away. However, his tests are fair and while he is condescending in class, he is much more receptive in office hours--I believe he wants to help us. Tests are very similar to the practice problems, so do those. The final is fair but challenging and comprehensive.","He is not clear in class, so you must rely on the textbook, which tends to be convoluted. His tests were somewhat fair if you did the homework, but the final will ruin your grade since he includes material on it that you never learned in class.","Cool guy, tests weren't hard at all.","Good professor! Very nice and helpful, and good at explaining concepts. Made class material that could be very painful fairly painless. Also seems passionate about his work!"],"courses":["CHEM241H","CHEM241","CHEM89","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241","CHEM241H","CHEM245H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
