Definitely have to do the readings to do well, and tests and papers are worth a lot so you have to do well or else you won't do well. Class is kind of boring but recitations  are good.","Sociolinguistics was incredibly fun. Not only is the topic itself interesting, but Roberge managed to engage the class. His tests were straight forward. So long as you came to class and paid attention, you did well. Going to his office hours helps a lot. He answers questions and is happy to work with you.","Very interesting course. He was very enthusiastic and the reading was good, although it was quite a bit per week. He's tests are fill-in-the-blank and essay questions, and as long as you answer the question and provided decent details it was ok. Recommend going to office hours and talking to him. He is very open and will help you.","Roberge is probably the most understanding professor I've had. As long as you try to do your best (coming to class, going to his office hours upon occasion) he will reciprocate your effort with understanding and grace.","I took a Language Change class with him. He was once an editor, which means he will edit the heck out of anything that crosses his path. It's very eye-opening but difficult to follow him down his many digressions.","I took an Early Germanic Culture Seminar with Paul, and had a great time! He was helpful and friendly, although we did use powerpoint quite a lot. He helped de-fog some difficult early texts.","Roberge is a stickler for scholarly accuracy, and this will soon become very apparent in his overly-detailed explanations and qualifications for EVERYTHING said in class. Class discussion was for the most part unheard of, murdered us with enormously drawn out powerpoint sessions every day."],"courses":["GER216","LING541","GERM053","LING542","LING203","GERM053","LING172"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
