Her classes are enjoyable and she is always there for you if you need help. Favorite professor I've had.","Dr. Bruno is literally one of my most favorite professors ever. She is very knowledgeable about not only the language, but the world in general. She takes great effort to make sure all of her students are learning well, and she is an overall great person. I would recommend her class any day!","really rude to her students. she believes she is the only American to have ever learned Spanish, discourages her students and constantly reminds them they will never know Spanish as well as her. the class teaches very little about medical spanish, the course design is terrible","Dr. Bruno is an excellent teacher. She knows exactly what's going on and is extremely helpful. The class is very challenging, but I got a lot out of it.","Dr. Bruno is a nice enough person but she is fairly abrupt in manner and expects students to have a substantial knowledge base before the class begins.  The class is a combination of short essays and daily grammar exercises. All tests are fill-in-the-blank and impossible to study for. But the grading system is very forgiving.","Good class, learned a good bit. Shes really direct but in a good way, very helpful and really wants everyone to learn as much as possible. Homework almost everynight but rarely taken up, go over it in class. Shouldn't get less than a B unless your dumb or excessivly lazy. Liked the class, got more out of it than I had to put in.","Dr. Bruno is Great!  She is extremely nice.  At the beginning of the semester I was dreading her.  But, that turned out to be wrong she is AMAZING.  The entire Spanish for the Professions minor is great!  I loved this class!","SPAN 300 was not a very intense class. I placed into this class after 5 years worth of high school Spanish and a 5 on Spanish Lit. AP and this class was comparable to Spanish 3 or 4 in high school...basically a review of grammar...Dra. Bruno is  nice, friendly, and helpful. I just wish I had leaned more from her class."],"courses":["SPAN329","SPAN300","SPAN321","SPAN300","SPAN300","SPAN300","SPAN321","SPAN300"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":329,"section":1,"class_nbr":7017,"title":"SPAN PROF COMM ENGAGEMNT","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0303","days":"MWF","time":"09","instructor":"KIM,HOSUN","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["P"],"enrl_cap":22,"enrl_tot":22,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=798046","fname":"Hosun","lname":"Kim","quality":"3.6","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Participation matters (4)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["CARING","TOUGH GRADER","RESPECTED","GET READY TO READ","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA"],"comments":["Prof. Kim is super nice and loves helping his students learn! His tests are pretty tough. I've taken two classes with him (thinking I could pull an A off the second time and got a B+). Oral interview is graded tough and he doesn't give late forgiveness. If you really want to learn Spanish, take his class. Office hours are stellar!!","I did not like professor Kim at all as a teacher.  He is a very nice person but he grades really tough and does not give helpful feedback.  He expects the students to know things that my friend in 203 didn't even know.  His expectations are ridiculous and his exams were the hardest I've ever taken.  My advice: take another professor.","Professor Kim is a great lecturer, but seems to be very unorganized. He is usually very helpful if you go to office hours or come to him with questions in class, but he didn't return any of our assignments on time and fell behind on assigning our oral interviews by an entire week.","While I think Professor Kim is a great teacher for 100-204 Spanish classes, I would caution anyone taking his class for levels 260 or higher. Professor Kim expects a lot from his students and is not very clear in his teachings or instructions to students on assignments.","Great professor. Period.","He is an amazing teacher. Super passionate. If you have questions when you have doubt he will make it clear however he can. Really animated and made class fun. Do outside reading because he discusses everything in class. Office hours are super helpful as well.","Dr. Kim really is a great teacher. He's very passionate about teaching Spanish. He does sometimes make a point when people are wrong, but he doesn't mean to humiliate anyone. He is a good teacher who truly cares that his students learn the material. I would recommend him for 102. (Took it during Summer Session)","U took his hybrid class so I was a little hesitant but it wasn't that bad at all. He really is a nice guy and tries to make the class as interesting as possible. It was shocking how much I learned in a 50 min session. The thing about his class is that everything is evenly distributed so even if you mess up you can make it up. He truly cares!","Not enough speaking. Class did not meet often enough to get a useful grasp on the language. Although English is not his first language, he is easy to understand. Helpful. I strongly dislike the use of online teaching tools - now I can read and write Spanish, but am barely above 101 level in speaking. Very disappointing semester.","He may be OK for 101-204 but I would avoid higher levels with him. He made this class so ridiculously hard. Not to mention boring. And the reviewer who mentioned that he makes a scene when you're wrong about something - spot on. He enjoys pointing out the minutest of his students' mistakes, but the thing is, he makes plenty of them himself! Avoid.","Kim is an okay professor, he is very militant in his teaching style, the main reason I score him low is that when you answer incorrectly he makes a big scene and you feel so dumb for not know the answer. other then that he is a pretty good guy","dr.kim is so passionate about teaching, and it is apparent in his approach. he is quite thorough in his lectures and speaks clearly so that he may be understood. i enjoyed his class a lot - he used powerpoints frequently to coincide with his lectures.i would definitely recommend dr.kim to anyone who wants to become fluent in spanish","He's very animated and loves to teach. Great guy, quite entertaining. The subject matter is kind of a bore, but he tries to make it interesting and fun.","Great professor.  Very enthusiastic, and makes spanish... which i hate, prett fun.  Not a hard professor, there is a midterm, a &quot;mini&quot; midterm, and a final, plus participation and a presentation grade.  An overall nice guy.  A little weird at first because he has a korean accent but I got used to it."],"courses":["SPAN101","SPAN102","SPAN102","SPAN260","SPN102","SPAN260","SPAN102","SPEN102","SPAN102","SPAN260","SPAN101","SPAN203","SPAN260","SPAN3"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":329,"section":3,"class_nbr":7019,"title":"SPAN PROF COMM ENGAGEMNT","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0401","days":"MWF","time":"12","instructor":"MARTIN,VICTORIA D","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["P"],"enrl_cap":22,"enrl_tot":22,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=541076","fname":"Victoria","lname":"Martin","quality":"3.0","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Participation matters (1)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["She is a pretty tough grader - compared to my SPAN105 teacher, she was MUCH more difficult. Extremely hard on participation grades - didn't let me \"make up\" credit when I was in the HOSPITAL (though I did end up with a 90, after going to class every single time afterwards and participating my ass off). However she is fluent and gives great info.","She is a pretty strict grader, especially compared to the other SPAN 203 teachers. She does not explain why she marks off most of the time when you ask her. She also marks down on the entire class for participation grade, which should be an automatic A if you pay attention and show up to class. However, she does not treat it like this.","I thought the class was really easy. Especially for the 4th level of college spanish. yeah she gives a lot of quizzes but they are incredibly easy. she tests and grades really fairly. the assignments are pretty easy too. she isn't the most helpful professor but she is nice and you should pull an A or B with little effort","The reading is what's killer--expect a fair amount of homework every night. The analyzing isn't that bad once you get used to it, but if you don't pay attention in class you're screwed on the tests! Expect questions on exact quotations, themes, authors, time periods, cultural differences between countries, etc.","Assigns a lot of homework, especially nights before tests, so on top of studying for an exam, you have to worry about doing the assignments. Quizzes and in class essays almost everyday in class. Impractical grading scale-do better on in class rough draft comps verses final drafts. Does not make herself accessible for outside help. Avoid this class!","She's really nice and the class is pretty easy, especially if you have a good background in Spanish and can put together a half-decent essay. I think its as interesting as you make it- if you read and think about it, class is a lot more interesting because you will have more to add.","She's a mediocre teacher. She's good about sensing whether or not class is ready for upcoming tests, etc. and she'll change dates around. Do the homework. She's not that easy, but at this level, easiness shouldn't really be expected. Overall, the class isn't that bad.","She is a good teacher but she is not an easy one. If you want to continue on further in spanish then take her.","She's a fair grader and will postpone quizzes or speak in English if she can tell the class isn't doing well.  She's cool.","No Comments"],"courses":["SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN204","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN21","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN003"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR"]}}]
