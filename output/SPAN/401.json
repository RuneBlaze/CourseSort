This class was the best I've taken so far- she is excited about the material, engaging and halarious. While participation is necessary, she makes it easy. The assignments and readings are interesting and workload isn't hard at all. Final project is a movie project that she grades fairly on. TAKE HER!!","Dr. Amat is a very sweet lady, but I did not enjoy her class. The curriculumwork from SPAN 105 is the same no matter your teacher, but Dr. Amat grades significantly harder than any other professor. I wouldn't mind but I felt I came out of the class having learned nothing. Be ready to work.","Dr. Amat is one of the most passionate professors I've had. She is always willing to help and has an obvious passion for what she teaches. Dr. Amat does grade quite difficultly, but that only makes you more prepared for 203.","Tough grader but she teaches a lot in class. A lot of span 105 profs play games, which she doesn't, but she you end up learning more than any other prof will for 105 which prepares you for the tests. She really cares about her students and is accepting and helpful with questions. Friendly woman. Lively and energetic","She is a tough teacher no doubt. But she is helpful and nice to all her students and you can definitely tell she cares about their success. If you are willing to go to her office hours she will answer all your questions.","Dra. Amat is a fun, engaging, lively teacher. Her class is challenging but you learn so much from the discussions. There are few essays through the course and one final video project which is fun. She is a tough but fair grader. If you work hard and put effort into the class, you can definitely get an A. She is very helpful and I enjoyed her class!","Class is disorganized and not always interesting, but it's not so bad.  Tests and quizzes can be difficult.  If you're not comfortable with Spanish, then I would look for another professor.  She moves quite quick and as a native speaker speaks very fast.  It's good in the long run at practicing fluidity, but you might be overwhelmed at first.","Great teacher if you are really interested in learning Spanish!","Profesora Amat is awesome. She assigns a ton of reading, but it's interesting and she's good at helping us to understand it. You'll have to look up a lot of words in the reading, but if you do, you'll learn so much in this class.","Dr. Amat's class was wonderful. From the first day of class, she engulfs her students in a world of Spanish. The entire class is conducted in Spanish.  She is entertaining and covers material that is intriguing and teaches students how to embrace the Spanish culture. She assigns work out of book often.  Overall great class.  I highly recommend!","She is a great professor--very funny and makes class entertaining!  She also seems to really love teaching the class.  I'd have to say that she does grade harder than other 203 teachers, and gives significantly more work but all in all a great professor!","Very interesting class. She's an excellent teacher with a superb understanding of the material.","Kinda ditzy, but very approachable.  A tough grader, finds a way to make simple ideas very difficult.  Very average professor.","Very approachable, friendly, and down to earth. Gets to know students and cares about them. The class is fairly difficult, but she grades fairly and definitely prepares you for exams. The only bad part is the daily quizzes.","Pretty easy class, conducted mostly in Spanish.  Native speaker, so she's got a good accent.  If you put in at least an hour of work before every class, you'll do fine.  Good class if you're in it to learn.","Great professor, loves her subject matter, very excited about teaching.  Midterms are very reasonable (in class multiple choice and short answer, plus short take home essay).  There is A LOT of work for this class, tho.  Positive:  easy to make up for bad grade on one thing; negative:...it's a lot of work.  Great prof, if you don't mind constantly having something to get done.","Good teacher.  Gives a lot of hard quizzes though.  Takes attendance!!","GET REAL.  SHE GIVES MOST OF THE CLASS A &quot;B&quot; OR LOWER, REGARDLESS.  FORGET THE CHALLENGE, GRAD SCHOOLS DON'T CARE.  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED, IF YOU TAKE HER CLASS YOUR GPA GOES DOWN.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. FIND ANOTHER PROFESSOR.  DON'T MAKE A BAD MISTAKE YOUR FRESH. YEAR OR SOPH. YEAR! AWFUL PROFESSOR.","If you're seeking a good challenge and an entertaining class, take Span 21 with her.  Shows lots of enthusiasm in class and grades strictly but very fairly.  She ensures you are well prepared for quizzes/exams and reviews during class. Class is done 99% of the time in Spanish.","Instead of helping, this professor told me to &quot;go see the tutor.&quot; I tested out of ALL required spanish classes as Fresh. yet only managed a &quot;B&quot; in her class.   Maybe she has favorites&#63; Be warned!"],"courses":["SPAN255","SPAN105","SPAN105","SPAN105","SPAN105","SPAN260H","SPAN255","SPAN202H","SPAN260","SPAN203H","SPAN203","SPAN260","SPAN046","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN46","SPAN3","SPA","SPAN021","SPA"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWFUL"]}}]
