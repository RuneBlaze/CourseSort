That being said, he is a very ineffective lecturer. The majority of his examples are from before most students were born. Readings are assigned, but you can get an A by just skimming and paying somewhat attention in class. Tests were extremely easy and paper was simple.","Dr. Mackuen is brilliant and great to talk to during his office hours. If you are at all interested in politics, or just want a unique learning experience, absolutely take his POLI 409 class. It was a great experience getting to work with other students to write a modern constitution and Mackuen provides that extra push to help you succeed.","Really nice and really funny. Pretty good lecturer. Very laid back. Exams were long but easy. Also had to do a group research project. Even though I liked Dr. MacKuen and the subject of the class, I think he could have been a little more organized and clear with his lectures."],"courses":["POLI101","POLI409","POLI418"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
