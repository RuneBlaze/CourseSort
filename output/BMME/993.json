sometimes, but Devin's philosophy on assignments was very refreshing. If you complete the tasks the way he asks, you should be alright. The tasks are at times hard, but he's totally willing to help you. Predictable exams; very few surprises. Was fun to learn from and easy to work with.","Great lecturer, I wish I would have gone to class more because it was fun and interesting. Also easiest class ever lol.","Really great professor. Very good at simplifying difficult science/engineering concepts down to an understandable level and also has a good sense of humor. Very likable guy and the class is a super easy A. Really cool classroom too.","He has a true passion for BME that shows through his teaching. He teaches what he thinks is best for the students and does it in an extremely entertaining way. There are often group presentations in class but they are less than a minutes and extremely informal (not graded). Everyone gets an A with almost no effort."],"courses":["BMME351","BMME101","BMME101","BMME101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
