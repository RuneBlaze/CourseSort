You have to watch these flipped classroom lectures online that are way longer than they need to be so you don't always get what's important. He clarifies well in class though and I think he's better than many give him credit for. I took it as a gen ed and enjoyed it","Class time is a waste.  80% of my grade is based off a group project that is brought up once before the last week of class.  Honestly, this restoration ecology course had potential to be (and from the course description sounded like)  a field intensive hands on learning experience, and it wasn't at all.","He's experimenting with a flipped-classroom approach and he's terrible at it. The material is too complex to understand clearly after watching a lecture video before class, and there is never an opportunity in class to ask questions specifically about the homework. When you do ask questions his answers come across as smug and condescending.","If you're looking to take a science class just to fulfill a general ed requirement, steer clear of this class! Dr. Bell expects you to come into ENEC 202 with in-depth knowledge about the subject. For a humanities major, this class was incredibly difficult. Also, he gives 50-60 question tests to be completed in 50 minutes and expects way too much.","He likes to make you think outside the box and see the whole picture. There I no simple or easy answer but any effort with him goes a long way.","you get what you put into it, very fair","Dr. Bell and his TAs (especially Brian) are extremely helpful. This class takes some work, but it's definitely doable to get an A, ESPECIALLY since there are review sessions three times a week. Take advantage of those sessions, seriously, and you'll do well in the class.","Probably the best professor I've had at Carolina. He lectures from his power points, which he puts up on Sakai, lectures clearly and stays on topic. He's eager to help students learn. Go to the review sessions! The class itself is a BEAST and the review sessions make all the difference!","Very helpful and shows that he truly cares that people are learning the material. Good lecturer, often very clear. Class is tough, but you learn so much by the end of it. GO TO REVIEW SESSIONS (either with Bell or the TAs). these are extremely helpful in reinforcing the concepts.","In this class Professor Bell steers discussion over a large array of challenges, concepts and ideas concerning ecosystem management. The reading is daunting for a non-science major and his assignments are difficult. As long as you keep communication lines open with him you can get a good grade. He is extremely interested in how much and how well his students are learning the material. Come prepared, he can tell when you are not.","Professor Bell is a very dedicated teacher, and he strives to help every student learn the material. He encourages you to think critically about the material and key concepts. He is well prepared for lecture and makes himself extremely available if you need extra help. I am glad I took a class with him.","Professor Bell doesn't believe in curves or staying on topic in lecture. He doesn't know how to lecture so he acts like its a class of 30. Go to class, the review sessions, and do well in lab (the TAs are kick ass) and you'll do well. Also, despite the rumors he's not hot, he just looks it from far away. In closing, BLUE CRABS!"],"courses":["ENEC202","ENEC304","ENEC 202","ENST202","ENST490","ENST202","ENST202","ENST202","ENST202","ENST462","ENST202","ENST202"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
