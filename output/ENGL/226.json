Prepare for close readings and a lot of tough/conflicting ideology. He is very helpful in his office hours and makes an effort to know everyone in his class. He really believes in his students and their abilities and he's so encouraging!","Dr. Barbour is my favorite professor at UNC. He is obviously a genius and knows all the texts backwards and forwards. He will make you work for it, and the papers are really long, but they are worth it. His lectures are passionate and intense.","Possibly the hardest class I took my first semester, but worth it. He's an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable. Very passionate on the subject and obviously an expert in his field. However, he is also a tough grader and there is a lot of reading and analysis. And usually the prompts won't be things that we studied. Overall a good class.","Professor Barbour was a great professor who consistently and enthusiastically helped students. He was very passionate about his subject; he worked hard to make the subject material somewhat interesting and while it was a bit of work to do well, it was definitely worth it.","Rapid lecturer, but don't be intimidated! Happy to help with papers, and a very nice guy. That said, start papers early and edit carefully. Three shorter papers and one long research paper, but the midterm isn't bad at all. A brilliant prof who is clearly an expert in his field. Lecture-based, not as much discussion. Take it!","This is my favorite professor ever.  Not only in the English department but the whole school.  He teaches at a fast pace with the ultimate enthusiasm.  I have taken him three times since being a student at UNC.  Take his class, you will not regret it and you will learn so much.","He is an awesome professor. I was intimidated by him at first because he paces and yells throughout lecture, but he keeps things interesting. I learned a lot in this class. Recitations are pointless, but the TAs are nice and helpful.","Probably the most I've EVER learned in a class. Barbour is incredibly knowledgeable and his lectures are always fascinating. A great help on writing papers, in everything from choosing a topic to proofreading. He's funny, but also intellectually demanding, serious, and thought-provoking. Highest recommendations (plus he brings his dog in sometimes)","The man basically paces in front of the class for an hour every day and yells at you.  Not a bad sort of yelling.  Just an animated exclamation of everything you could possibly want to know about Milton.  Be prepared for a fast pace.  He's amazing.  And very helpful when it comes to paper-writing.","WOAH this guy knows absolutely everything about the 17th century. Take good notes! His exams just ask you to spit back what he said in class. Super helpful with papers. I've never had a more enthusiastic teacher. Loved his class."],"courses":["ENGL120","ENGL228","ENGL120","ENGL228","ENGL120","ENGLENGL","ENGL120","ENGL120","ENGL230","ENGL160"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
