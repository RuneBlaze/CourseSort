Super helpful and very willing to accommodate if you show an interest in the work","This class was really enjoyable. It's a lot of powerpoint and lecture, but the subject matter was interesting and the recitation sections were usually really nice too. THe papers are tough, especially if you've never written historical analysis, but I also think my TA was a tough grader.","Here lectures cover a lot of material. Take good notes as her few slides per PPT are mostly pictures. Recitations are a must. TA has almost complete autonomy over your grades. Two papers, a midterm, and a final.

However, your TA decides your grade.  Your grade is composed of 2 essay midterms and 2 papers, all of which are graded EXTREMELY subjectively. Grades were never posted until the night before the final and little feedback was ever given. She also doesn't round for grades. I would not recommend taking this class","I took her Women Studies Class and she's a good prof. with pretty straight forward tests and very little homework however if you're worried about your grade it's almost entirely up to your TA  for the class.","Professor Turk is the best professor I have had at UNC. She changed the way I see history. Like all upper level history classes, there is lots of reading and writing, but the readings are interesting and she is great to talk to during office hours!","She was definitely my favorite teacher this semester. The class discussions are interesting and the class is not one of those where you are bored to death. The readings take no more than an hour or two per week. She is a tough grader on the papers but she is fair. Overall, I would definitely recommend her classes!!","Best professor I've had at UNC! She is exceptionally good at leading class discussion and getting you inspired by information you have absolutely no interest in. I highly recommend taking any class with her. Class attendance and readings are essential to doing well, but it's really not that much work. Readings take maybe an hour or two per week.","Professor Turk is very enthusiastic and has tons on energy! I enjoyed the class and the discussions. However, tons of reading and you never know what is relevant and what isn't... this was her first year at UNC and I think she put too much on the schedule for each class. 4 short papers.
