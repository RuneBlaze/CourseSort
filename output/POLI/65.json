She was very intelligent and knew what she was talking about. However, her lectures were very dull. Participation means literally showing up; don't let it deter you. If you try hard, you will be alright in the course!","Worst professor imaginable. Lectures are impossible to pay attention to, as is class discussion. There will be long pauses of awkward silence in discussion, but she ends up taking this out on participation grade. More than half of my class received 50% or lower in participation (10% of overall grade). She described this 50% as \"not failing.\" Avoid.","Just too much. Lectures are long and slides not uploaded. Lots of readings that no one talks about. Textbook content will be on the exam, but no one talks about it, either. Long paper with slightly instruction. TAs say different stuff and are not really helpful. I'm a POLI major and I did not enjoy this class.","Essentially, Professor Gray is Roz from Monsters, Inc. Her monotone voice could put even the most dedicated student to sleep. She tries to be funny, and on occasion will succeed, but not near enough to keep students awake. Her tests are tough, but there are decent study guides. If you have to take this class, hope for a good TA.","She is Sahara dry, dull,and can't navigate through any technological device. She gives a lot of reads that the class usually blows off because it is excessive, then she pops up with reading quizzes every now and then that has questions of a whole month's reads or so. It is ridiculous, and her lectures aren't helpful at all. She is nice but boring.","Want a more interesting class? Try Watching Paint Dry 101 with Professor Bland.","Boring.","The lectures aren't the most interesting, but they are very easy to follow. Tests contain precisely what is outlined on their study guides and if you study that material, they are not difficult.","Dr. Gray's class is somewhat dry, but she does make every attempt to make things interesting.","It isn't just that this class is painfully dull.  Even if you were to man up and tune in to the droning, you would realize that there's not even any content to learn.  No one in this class is here for anything other than fulfilling a BS requirement.  The textbooks are written for 5th graders, and the TAs are just as disillusioned as you will be.","Painfully boring, and her attendance policy is SUPER annoying...she gives sporadic attendance quizzes and the only two days i missed all semester we had one","This class was excrutiating. If you are a stroke victim, this class will be at the perfect pace for you, otherwise be prepared to want to claw your eyes out. The only redeeming quality was a T.A. I suggest taking Wienberg instead...he was great","Lots of students did not like class with Dr. Gray, but I found her very knowledgeable, valuable, and interesting. She's a little soft-spoken, but she knows her stuff. Be sure to ask her questions, and joke with her."],"courses":["POLI101","POLI65","POLI101","POLI101","POLI65","POLI65","POLI101","POLI101","POLI65","POLI100","POLI101","POLI42","POLI006E"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","POOR","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
