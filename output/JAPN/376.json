However, he did not allot enough time for each student to complete their presentations and was fairly lax with the syllabus. Overall, I enjoyed being in his class.","Dr. Driscoll is a funny professor, but sometimes he'd go on tangents that'd last up to almost an hour. Since class is once a week, the readings are lengthy and sometimes the film are a little, but relevant. He's not that harsh of a grader imo, but still has high expectations. He really enjoys this subject and loves students who share the same zeal.","There's a lot of readings, but this semester the class met once a week at night, which perhaps was less than ideal as a time slot and made it seem like it was a lot of reading all at once and lectures last forever. Some of the movies were pretty weird.","Too much reading; very boring. Terrible","Terrible","Seriously such a great teacher. If you make a good argument he is super flexible on all assignments, and he is also an amazing lecturer, even if he does get a bit off topic sometimes.  Definitely plan to take more of his classes!","Awesome!","Pretty much a really chill professor.","Mark is a pretty crazy, cool dude.  Definitely on the left side of the spectrum and not afraid to show it.  This class was a majors-only course for International Studies, and I got a lot out of it without doing much of the reading.  Lots about scientific racism and how the West has messed up the world.  Easy A, but will make you think for it.","No Comments","Take it. Take it!
