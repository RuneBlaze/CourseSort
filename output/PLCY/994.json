His intellect, dedication, and endless wit shows in his lectures and especially during office hours. There's a lot of reading, and you're expected to participate. Yes it is a lot of work, but global health policy is not easy in the classroom or beyond.","Prof. Meier has the unique ability to turn something typically dry (i.e. Ethics courses) into something not only interesting, but applicable outside UNC. His upbeat, bright personality makes coming to class a pleasure. Sure to keep you entertained & motivated (including  special office hours  \"Late Night With Meier.\")  Not bad on the eyes either...","Professor Meier is without a doubt not only one of the best professors at UNC, but all around one of the best individuals within Chapel Hill. His passion for health and human rights permeates into the brains of every student that has a pleasure to be in his class, whether you want it to or not. Get ready to be indoctrinated in the best way possible","By far one of the best classes &  professors at UNC. Prof. Meier's passion & dedication to human rights & all health issues is evident in his savvy lectures, publications, & detailed feedback. He challenges every student to think about human rights, the UN system, & its role in tackling global health issues from various perspectives. Great class!!!","If justice, musicals, dancing, and fabulous powerpoints are your fancy, then this is the class for you! The class is tough and expectations are high, but Meier is great and will provide MORE THAN ENOUGH opportunities to get help. You should attend all lectures and Meier keeps them interesting and engaging, so you won't get bored!","Professor Meier is the greatest professor I have had at UNC. He cares greatly about his students  and their success well beyond the classroom. He is passionate about teaching and global health policy, and it shows in the time and dedication that he puts into each and every lecture. He's truly someone that will inspire you to \"don't stop believin'\".","Not many opportunities to receive a grade so focus on the midterm, exam, and essay or  you can risk slipping. Professor Meier is incredibly compassionate, communicative, and witty. (And he knows it). He is wonderful and worth getting to know in office hours. Much singing, many photos, a good time had by all.","Best class I've taken at Carolina. Professor Meier makes you want to come to class and do well. He doesn't post lectures, and he takes an attendance grade, so going to class is important. Luckily, his lectures are a lot of fun. He is hands-down the most upbeat, fabulous, and caring professor I've had at Carolina.","Meier's class is not easy, but is incredible. The content is really eye-opening and he makes it so interesting to learn. This is the one class that I have always been excited to go to. I highly encourage everyone to take it.","Absolutely amazing. Puts so much effort into what could easily be a very dry course. Go to office hours if you have any questions, or if you don't- go anyway. Very inspiring and extremely helpful to students if you put in some effort to connect with the material.","Absolutely fedorable, I'm a huge admeierer.","Prof. Meier is AMAZING! He is absolutely HILARIOUS, incredibly smart, and cares about students! He makes himself extremely available and offers a lot of help with achieving your professional goals (preparing for interviews, contacts). His lectures are really interesting. He also bakes cookies and even made us an ice sculpture! Take this course!","Professor Meier cares deeply about his students. He is passionate about the subject matter and he injects so much enthusiasm into every lecture. Professor Meier is also always available to answer questions about material covered in class or to chat about the passions and career interests of his students.","The class was very interesting! Professor Meier did an amazing job at explaining human rights in a global health context! After taking this class you will find your passion in the global health field!!","Meier truly was excellent. The class wasn't easy by any means (and the material is a tad dry in and of itself), but the instructor truly made it worthwhile. Obsession with musicals was a bit confusing. One of the most caring professors I've had at UNC. Will challenge you, but will cheer you on. Seriously take a class with him - you won't regret it.","Great class! So much fun. Between the music and references, the topic and the stories, I'm not sure you can find a better class. Though at times the content wasn't my favorite, Meier always was, and it was a pleasure to come to class every day.","Absolutely one of my best Carolina experiences. It's such a treat to be taught by a professor that is truly passionate about the subject matter, and I feel lucky to have learned about such an important topic in this manner. I can't recommend this course highly enough--you will work hard, but it will be good for you (promise).","An excellent introduction to the international human rights framework and international law relating to health. Also fedoras, suits, and being fabulous. You'll learn a lot about all of those things too. Dr. Meier cares deeply about what he teaches, and you should absolutely take his class before you leave UNC.","Professor Meier gave me my first \"Carolina experience\" in the classroom. He was inspiring, hilarious, dedicated, and quite fond if not obsessed with musicals/theatre/dance. This class is difficult, but worth the extra work and time. Meiers is always there to help if needed and has very helpful office hours (go to them, go to ALL of them).","He is a wonderful professor, though unconventional.

His lectures were very informational and hilarious. Great man.","Great lecturer fun class.","An awesome professor. Public policy - particularly the readings - can get a little cumbersome and boring sometimes, but he does an excellent job of making it as interesting as possible while having to graze over an insane amount of topics in a short period of time. A large class, so it's hard to get to know him, but he's super helpful when you ask.","Dr. G is a knowledgable professor teaching a very vague class. Plcy 101 has a lot of material, but he touches it all and keeps you interested by being interactive and using multimedia. You must read the assigned policy briefs to pass the final. Would I call Dr. G one of the best profs at UNC? Probably not, but he's a really good guy nonetheless.","One of the best professors I've had. Makes every class interesting and really cares about his students. It is well worth your time to come to class because he clarifies difficult points in the readings and makes the ideas from the textbook (READ IT TO SUCCEED IN CLASS!) more applicable. Wish I could take the class again or another course by him.","Dr. Gitterman is absolutely great! His lectures are very clear and quite interesting considering the material can sometimes get a little boring. He does a great job of making you appreciate public policy. There are few assignments throughout the semester, and you absolutely have to attend class. It's not hard, his lectures will make you want to go!","Don't listen to the salty kids-- one of the best professors at UNC. He does hold you accountable, but makes class worth coming to with lectures and videos that keep you engaged and interested in the material. He wants to be fair and he wants you to learn, which is refreshing in a professor.","An amazing professor! He really cared about the students and stressed learning and becoming interested in the material rather than making his class difficult to pass. My TA (McHale) was great; just as engaging as he was and really helpful with any questions I had. The work was easy and little. Great start to UNC! (PS: do NOT buy ANYTHING for PLCY)","Great professor and really tries to connect with the students by showing videos and telling short anecdotal stories to keep you interested.  Make sure to go to class, because although the topics may not be super exciting are very informational and on his tests.  A must have teacher a one point in your Carolina career. If motivated easy A.","Awesome prof!  You have to go to class, but his lectures are really interesting and entertaining and make you want to go.  He really cares about the students and will help you with anything you want.  He's more interested in making sure you learn than making the class difficult.  Everything is graded very fairly.  Best prof I've had at UNC!","I loved this professor. I would recommend my friends and other take his class. It's not easy, but it's not supposed to be. I loved learning about everything in policy and enjoyed his enthusiasm and love for the subject. his lectures are interesting and keep you entertained.","ATTEND CLASS. It may seem like you don't have to, but his TA's monitor the PollEverywhere and they will catch you skipping. Readings are not necessary, and he gives helpful study guides for the exams. One big paper, but outside of that its not a lot of work. He's super entertaining in class, and he shows a lot of videos, which make you want to go","Awesome professor. He kept the class entertaining and gave realistic examples of Public Policy in action. You do need to attend class to do the Poll Everywhere questions and his lectures are the most helpful when it comes to studying for the exams.","This was by far one of my favorites classes. He makes class so interesting and you actually WANT to come to class. Has a little bit of a fowl mouth so if you are sensitive to that beware. Overall, his TA's grade very fairly and are always able to help!","Not as easy as everyone says.  Not particularly work intensive, but not an easy A. The work you do have to do is usually hard to ace.  Midterm and final I got a solid B, pretty much everything was a solid B for me. Gitterman is cool and funny. Not very interesting class, didn't learn much. Readings aren't necessary even for the final.","Excellent professor. Really cares about his students, engaging, and informative. Even if you aren't interested in policy, I recommend a class with Dr. Gitterman.","Took PLCY101 for maymester and loved it. Best professor I've had so far. His lectures were interesting and made the 3 hours fly by. The work was very manageable. He cares a lot about his students and what he teaches and it shows. Highly recommended.","Best professor I've had yet. Personable and hilarious. Extremely fair tests and assignments - no curve balls. He really wants you to succeed, and he will help you with ANYTHING if you just ask. My recitation was a little unnecessary, but it was probably just my TA. Everyone should take this class - it gave me the final push to become a PLCY major.","Gitterman is an excellent professor. He is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and accessible. He definitely has the best handle on how to engage a 250+ person lecture of any professor I've ever had. Also, he is VERY clear about what he wants in assignments and is fair in grading. There are no curve balls.","Agree with almost all of the previous sentiments on Dr. G."],"courses":["PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
