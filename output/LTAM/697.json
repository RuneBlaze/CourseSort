You can download the power points and use them to study along with the study guides that she gives for the midterm and final, which are not too hard and graded very fairly. She wants you to do well and isvery flexible, even let me re-take the midterm so I could get a better grade.","Lectures are long and read from papers she holds during class, it's as if she's reading prose to the class. Not sure what it is about this method, but it makes the lectures dry despite being on interesting material. I've asked for help once from a TA and he was extremely responsive. An extra-credit paper was offered for this section, not everytime","This class was very dry, the lectures were boring, and the readings were long. That being said, Professor Radding really wants her students to succeed. Getting an A or B in this class is not out of the question if you are willing to go to office hours.","No Comments","Horrible professor--stay far away.  Has no idea how to teach undergraduates or how to use powerpoint in a lecture.  She tries to be friendly but actually has a very alpha-type, bulldog-ish, unapproachable personality that makes her defensive and even hostile.  I cannot imagine why UNC hired her.","Radding's class is sooooo boring!!!  I had her for a 3-hr seminar and the whole class was bored to tears.  Way to make a seminar full of bright students seem extremely dull.  DON'T TAKE HER CLASS!"],"courses":["HIST240","HIST240","HIST240","HIST530","HIST222","LTAM697"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
