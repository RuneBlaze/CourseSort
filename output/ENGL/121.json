She's irreverent and funny and just about all the things you want in a professor.  You do have to do the reading, but the syllabus is great, so it's not like it's a hassle.  A plus plus plus.","Do yourself a favor and take her class, she's supermegafoxyawesome. It is essential that you do the reading, because the discussions won't give you the info. You'll want to know where your towel is even if you don't feel like participating. Really, really funny and a fantastic teacher.  Grade is from papers/final and her grading isn't harsh at all.","Do not leave UNC without taking a class with this woman! Her classes are so interesting and she's a great teacher and she's hilarious! Classes are pretty much self-guided discussion, which is great if you enjoy that. Def need to participate in class so make sure you do the reading - she might ask for your opinion. AWESOME LADY!","Excellent syllabus, good mix of theory and literature, extremely knowledgeable about the subject.  Her comments on papers were very useful, and she is very good at guiding research projects.  I hope to take another class with her.","Watch your grammar and citations on papers! Also, the discussions tend to be a little unguided, make sure you comprehend the main issues in the books."],"courses":["ENGL356","ENGL121","ENGL356","ENGL356","ENGL355","ENGL390","ENGL92C"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":121,"section":2,"class_nbr":8915,"title":"BRITLIT, 19TH/EARLY 20TH","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0304","days":"MW","time":"15","instructor":"LITHGOW,HILARY EDWARDS","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":22,"enrl_tot":22,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":1,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1737580","fname":"Hilary","lname":"Lithgow","quality":"4.8","easiness":"2.8","help":"2.8","clarity":"2.8","topTag":"Gives good feedback (4)","grade":"2.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","RESPECTED","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK"],"comments":["I'm so glad I took Lithgow when I did because I'm able to write college level papers because of her. I would highly recommend her. You will most likely have homework due every class, but there is no midterm or final exam. Also, she helps you with literally everything on your papers and she is always available for office hours.","Lithgow was a phenomenal teacher. I had her for ENGL 105i and she's a huge reason for why I did so well on papers for other classes. If you try, you'll do fine. She cares immensely and is very flexible. Entertaining and open to new ideas as well.","She is a very involved teacher and wants everyone to do well. If you put in the effort you will do well.","Professor Lithgow is one of the most helpful professors I have ever had.  She gives deadlines if you need them, always offers helpsuggestionsoffice hours for any assignment, and truly cares about your education.  The class requires work, but she is extremely helpful through every step of her assignments.  Definitely recommend her.","Fabulous! Gives extensions, no questions asked, as long as you're 48 hours before the deadline. Class is discussion based. Reading is heavy (similar to ENGL 120), and she does quiz frequently, but she's a moderately easy grader on papers. Incredibly nice & supportive - couldn't recommend her enough!","Lithgow is the most helpful and caring professor I've had at UNC. Classes are totally discussion based. There are reading quizzes but they are super easy if you do any of the reading.  Also, Lithgow is an adviser in the English dept so she is super knowledgeable about the entire department!","Dr. L is a great professor. She is very thorough with paper comments and is helpful every step of the way. The research section of 105i is excellent and Dr. L did a great job with the material. Take the research ENGL105i with Dr. L if you can! Great transition class from high school to college.","I may have only been at Carolina for one semester now, but I know that Dr. L has got to be one of the best professors here. She is so energetic and really gets you excited about the class. ENGL 105 was easily my favorite class this semester,","My favorite professor i've had at Carolina so far.","Super helpful. There is a ton of reading for this class, and she'll quiz you on most of it. There is a LOT of listening to lecture, but it's not boring. Though attendance is mandatory, she's understanding of illnesses and will give extensions if you ask early enough.","Dr Lithgow is one of the msot helpful and engaging professor I met. She is pretty demanding for her students but she makes sure you become better in writing at the end of the course.the content is very engaging as well, but definitely need to put in the effort.","Lithgow is an extremely helpful professor who really attempts not to waste anyones time. Her classes are really engaging, especially for non-english majors."],"courses":["ENGL105I","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105I","ENGL121","ENGL121","ENGL105I","ENGH105I","ENGL105","ENGL121","ENGL127","ENGL127"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":121,"section":990,"class_nbr":11894,"title":"BRITLIT, 19TH/EARLY 20TH","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":7,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
