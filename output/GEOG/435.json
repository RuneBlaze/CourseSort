Yes, painfully.","She is very passionate about inequality, development etc., but i found her lectures incredibly boring. She definitely knows her stuff, but i struggled to pay attention. She posts all her ppts. online, so Id say attendance isn't mandatory. I did about half the reading and did well in the class. The essays aren't too bad, and use her study guides","Havice has a passion for this subject of inequality. She anticipates everyone coming to class, ready to learn from what students have read the night before. The papers aren't too difficult, but it requires to read the readings. Definitely not an easy A, but if you work for it, the A is definitely there. Just go to class and listen, I hardly did...","Unless you are a Geography major and have a dedicated interest do NOT take this course. She usually teaches upper level Geography, and expects each student to have prior knowledge. There's no textbook and she assigns boring, long readings. Only two tests, both are short answer tests and TA's grade papers. Her teaching is very confusing.","I really enjoyed this class. It's not exactly an interesting one to sit through- there were definitely times when it seemed to drag on- but she was very passionate about the content. It made me highly consider Geography as a major. It's not too hard to do well in here if you pay attention in lecture and start the papers early (as I did not lol).","Spare yourself from this class if you can! She doesn't curve at all and the class gets so detailed and boring.","She seems to forget this is an intro course, and that students aren't required to have prior knowledge of many of the topics she goes over and as a result won't go in depth with certain ideas. She is not a very entertaining lecturer and teaches directly off the powerpoint, and the midterm comes directly from the final."],"courses":["GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG130","GEO130","GEOG130","GEOG130","GEOG130"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}}]
