The readings were dry and all on the same topic (Latino voting behavior). Lectures and discussions became repetitive. The novels we read were really interesting though. Overall, an easy A, but LOTS of reading (70+ pages a class).","Professor Benjamin is AMAZING! I took her first-year seminar and it grew my interest in politics and pushed me to change my major. She is very down to Earth and has a very understandable teaching style. The class is discussion intensive, but I'm fairly certain everyone received an A.","Professor Benjamin is awesome. She really knows what she's talking about, and loves the subject matter, which really comes off in class. It's a lot of reading, but if you do the reading and pay attention in class you'll do well. She's also very helpful if you go see her during office hours. I loved her class and would take another with her!","I had her for a first year seminar that was very interesting, and I think most of the class got an A. She is very approachable and open to just chatting about the subject during office hours. There was a ton of reading, but the novels were really interesting and it wasn't totally necessary to do the other readings. Great professor!","Her first year seminar was wonderful. The assigned novels are great - they were entertaining so reading at night was more like pleasure reading and less like work - but it was a lot of reading. The assignments were simple and her expectations clear. She is very young and easy to relate to so class and office hours were actually fun to go to.","While she is very enthusiastic, her lectures can be hard to follow at times. The class was more fun when discussions were encouraged. Overall, I thought that she was a lot of fun. She's very youthful and is good at relating to students. Her teaching style could use improvement, but I'll cut her a break since this was her first class at UNC.","Andrea is very smart, enthusiastic and funny. She is very strict about behavior during class and that made some people dislike her. I didn't mind, though. She clearly expects a lot from students. TONS of reading. Speaks very fast and could do a little more to mix things up in class. Grades were reasonable and office hours were very helpful."],"courses":["POLI71","POLI71","POLI419","POLI71","POLI71","POLI195","POLI195"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
