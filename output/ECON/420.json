In those moments, you pause to look up and realize you are witnessing just that. Mike Aguilar is a fantastic professor. I had taken 3 courses with him at UNC and have now gone far into a PhD elsewhere. Without him, I would have never made it off the ground.","First of all he is an amazing teacher. No doubt about that.  However, the emphasis in his lectures can be misleading. He tries to give students a general sense, but his hws and exams are 90%  math. He would casually mention some points and you would likely think those are not important; they are. Don't let his economist charm fool you.","Great lectures, but difficult tests. Overall a really interested and engaging person, even if the class is really tough.","This is no easy class. Do every extra credit opportunity. Go to the help sessions and I don't just mean the one that's the night before the homework is due. Do practice questions. Ask questions. I recommend office hours for concepts/theory and help sessions for homework. Tests are doable with practice.","Very hard class but Mike is the man. Super 90's Wall Street. You will have to put in a lot of your own time if you want to do well, but it is worth it for future econ classes. The tests are very hard but not impossible. Homework is difficult but the TAs offer lots of review sessions to go through them before they are due.","Very poor quality of instruction. Class topic is complex and broad, but the professor barely explains the materialhe'll brush over it in a few seconds, and only uses about a third (literally) of total class time actually teaching. He almost never does examples, though difficult math is on tests. Expect to struggle unless you're a math genius.","420 is the bane of every econ major's existence. Aguilar makes it interesting, although the exams are impossible and the homework takes time. However, he curves well and gives opportunities for extra credit.","Professor Aguilar is clearly very smart and enthusiastic about what he teaches, which is good, except that he assumes everyone else is equally as smart and enthusiastic about the subject. I looked forward to his class every day because lectures were interesting, but the class moves very fast and the material is extremely difficult. Lots of hw.","Professor Aguilar is a great professor with extensive and interesting knowledge about the economy and its various nuances. While his lectures were fascinating and relatively easy to follow, the homework and tests were very difficult. You will not do well in this class if you don't go to lectures and TA sessions. Optional extra credit debates.","Professor Aguilar is very smart, although probably too smart for his own good. His homework and exams are very difficult and asks questions about material that hasn't always been covered.  He isn't the clearest professor, but his inclusion of current events makes the class fairly interesting. You should read the book, but you will learn a lot.","One of the toughest courses I have taken at UNC, but definitely worth it. Honestly, in this one class I feel like I've learned more about the economy than all of my other econ courses combined. AMAZING teacher. He is very difficult in terms of content and grading, but Aguilar is incredibly helpful and wants you to succeed in his class and beyond.","I got 100 on the midterm and became really lazy, so I did poorly on the final and got a B+. There are only a few multiple choice questions on the tests, which makes grades a little arbitrary. People who you know are a lot worse at the class than you can end up doing a lot better if they are lucky when guessing. If math is hard for you, good luck.","Aguilar is the best economics professor at UNC, hands down. He is not only a good researcher (which is how many professors are rated by the school), he gets really high marks on pedagogy. He just knows how to teach. We were learning some of the most difficult material I've ever seen, and he made it feel easy (sort of). Take if you like challenge.","By far the most difficult class I have taken at UNC, but even as  an intern in a totally different field, I use information learned in his class on a daily basis. If your GPA can afford to take the class, do it. Oh, and make sure you know Excel.","Tough class, but you will learn a ton through the work he requires. Any econ major should definitely take his class, otherwise you might want to save your GPA.","The class is really tough but if you put the effort in, you will be rewarded. There is no recitation section but the review sessions are all but mandatory if you want to get a good grade. Tests and homework are insane in difficulty compared to the depth of lecture, however, Aguilar is a great teacher who really cares about helping his students.","Really hard class the only midterm was an essay and 6 hard multiple choice question which count for 50% percent of the grade.","Homeworks are helpful, he's a pretty good communicator, but his tests are totally unreasonable. They're very difficult and too long so you're essentially being graded on how fast you can take the test.  I don't mind professors who make a class difficult, but this was ridiculous.","Amazing Professor! Great lecturer! VERY knowledgeable and will never misrepresent students and tries to be as helpful as possible. His tests require you to REALLY understand econ concepts and theories. Not the easiest class, but you learn a lot if you pay attention and really try.","Excellent lecturer on macroeconomics.  Aguilar will give you a solid grounding in macro theory.  I learned a lot in this class about both the theory and the math.  Only problem is that he has too much confidence in the TAs, who are absolutely clueless.  Macro Journal is a great assignment that teach you how to interpret economic news."],"courses":["ECON423","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON423","ECON423","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON420","ECON101","ECON320"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"ECON","catalog_nbr":420,"section":2,"class_nbr":2067,"title":"IN TH/MONEY INC EMP","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Murphey","room":"0116","days":"TuTh","time":"15","instructor":"AGUILAR,MICHAEL D","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":120,"enrl_tot":103,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1182779","fname":"Michael","lname":"Aguilar","quality":"3.9","easiness":"4.3","help":"4.3","clarity":"4.3","topTag":"Tough Grader (10)","grade":"4.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["GROUP PROJECTS","RESPECTED","SKIP CLASS?
