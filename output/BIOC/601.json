There is no homework, reading, or lab assignments.  Exams are the only grades.  I asked him for practice problem or reading from the textbook and he literally said he didn't have any to suggest.  There were guest lecturers for two out of the four units who were terrible lecturers.  Traut isn't a great lecturer either.","Tough class! Traut was not the clearest professor I've had. His teaching method involves showing his students diagrams (that he has made) and discusses them. You will never really be sure of what you need to study. But, it's a required class for some majors so just take advantage of office hours (he's really nice) and try to stay awake during class"],"courses":["BIOC108","BIOC108"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
