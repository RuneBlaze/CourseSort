Not a hard grader at alland there is reading before every class, but it's on interesting material!  There is a lengthy journal due at the end of the semester & you should work in it at least twice a week, don't wait until the night before because trust me, it's a nightmare to complete at the last minute","Took AAAD 254 and absolutely loved his class! He's not a harsh grader and hardly gives out anything below a C. It's quite a bit of reading but the reading is usually very interesting. You will have to write in a journal throughout the semester about your personal opinion on current events, I recommend to actually write in it a least twice a week.","Took AAAD 254: Blacks in North Carolina and I enjoyed it immensely.  Coming in, I wasn't interested in African American studies at all, and now I'm enrolled in another class with him next semester.  I suggest doing the reading or you may look a little stupid in class. Great guy and pretty his evaluations of history are both refreshing and hilarious","Dr. Porter is a wonderful guy. He clearly loves the subject material and knows a lot about it. His class is just one giant discussion about the readings for the week and current events.  I would definitely recommend.","After completing my first class with Dr. Porter I immediately looked for a class to take in the spring of 2013. I was pleased to find this class, and was equally impressed with the structure of the class. As previously stated he a great TEACHER who happens to be a professor. I would highly recommend him.","Beware: He doesn't want to give A's anymore out of fear of being embarrassed in the community so he's only gonna give 1-2 A's in a class regardless of how many deserve A's. Find some money to travel around the country to write in your journal and you'll get an A. Fun class though!","Dr. Porter is an excellent professor. He is genuinely interested in the capability of his students and the dynamism of a variegated student body. I cannot praise him enough.","This professor will help you with any and all problems, as long as you ask. As long as you pay attention and come to class, you should breeze through!","I also took Porter's 102 class last semester.  My peer who said he no longer knows how to teach has gotten his/her facts all mixed up.  Porter is one of the few professors at this &quot;fine University&quot; who actually knows HOW to teach.  As a future teacher, I hope to be as insightful and inspirational as him.  He really is a gem in our system today!","Porter does not know how to teach anymore. He used to be a great teacher but all he does now is complain.","Porter makes class very fun because he has an extremely unorthodox style of teaching. DO THE READING! I tried to be very open minded in his class but unfortunately found that in many ways this class made me feel more **** by reinforcing stereotypes I'd hoped to break.","GREAT class! Rather than a boring focus on &quot;what you need to know for the exam&quot; you'll actually LEARN and be inspired. I can't say enough about how great this class was and many students in my class had multiple classes with him - he's quite popular.","Highly recommend.  Have taken 4 classes with him & signed up for 2 this semester","professor porter is a walking book! lot of reading assignments in this class; test are hard, but if you do the reading assignments you should be fine. interesting discussion and he respects everyone comments and opinions. The debates were the best! take care and take this class..........","Porter does nothing but complain all the time.  I found him to be a pompous know-it-all.  Not impressed.","PROFESSOR R, PORTER ASSIGNS READINGS OF INTEREST. I'VE NEVER READ A BOOK THAT I DID NOT WANT TO READ. ABSOLUTELY, TWO THUMBS, AND TEN TOES UP. SO KNOWLEDGEABLE, HELPFUL, LECTURES WITH INTERESTING CLASS DISCUSSIONS; GROUP MEETINGS, FAIR TEST AND &quot;NOT TIMED&quot;. NO A's ARE GIVEN BUT YOU WILL DEFINITELY EARN IT! UNC-NEED MORE PROFESSOR'S LIKE HIM!","Great prof.  As long as you read the books, you'll do just fine.  Attendance is mandatory, but you dont have to listen.  The class discussions are pointless and often go off on tangents (but still very interesting tangents).  Just read the books, and you'll do fine.","absolutely awesome professor.  do the readings come to class and you'll make him and everyone else happy","this guy is great. very interesting, clear in his lectures, but you take notes the entire time in class. tests directly reflect notes and readings.","Easy class if you do the work, porter will love you and give you a good grade.  You just have to stomach his SUPER liberal views about the world throughout the class period."],"courses":["AAAD254","AAAD254","AAAD254","AAAD298","AFAM263","AFAM101","AFAM280","AFAM304","AFAM304","AFAM102","AFAM102","AFRI101","HIST1","AFAM474","AFAM101","AFAM101","AFAM474","AFAM40","AFRI40","AFAM40"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
