There is a lot of reading (primary sources, no textbook), but that's to be expected in a mythology class. Not the easiest class I've taken (more difficult than expected for a 100-level course) and TAs grade really hard, but it's definitely interesting material.","Rives is a GREAT professor. He is engaging and funny and I thoroughly enjoy his lectures. I am a math major, so Classics is out of my expertise but I have an A- in the class now (and I haven't done the reading). 35% of your grade comes from open note/book quizzes.

There are many reading quizzes and pop quizzes, so go to class all the time.","JAmes Rives is a fabulous professor! He keeps everything interesting in Mythology. There is a lot of reading which you shouldn't let yourself fall behind on. Make sure you do your reading quizzes and go to class for the pop quizzes!
