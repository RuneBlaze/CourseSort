If you have the chance to take a class with him: DO IT!  The skills and composition techniques you learn will be invaluable.  I am almost sad that I didn't fail his class just to take it again.  Almost.","For his MultiMedia class: Really cool teacher. Always there when someone needed assistance. Instructions were occasionally slightly unclear, but he graded in regards to difficulties that people would be having. Kind of an easy class, he wants you to do well. Book was not needed.","Wonderful class. Use of new media such as web essays, mashups, and portfolios is excellent. Can't wait to take another class!","I took this class over the summer and it was great. Just do the assignments he gives and you will do well. He uses multiple forms of technology which is also fun. He is really nice and willing to help with anything you need. GREAT CLASS","This class was different then the normal english comp class.                        Dan displayed enthusiasm for his subject and a desire to share it with the students. Dan also set clear goals, used valid and appropriate assessment methods, and provided high-quality feedback on the assignments.",":) :) :) Favorite class of my career!","Dan is a teacher that requires you to ask your own questions and interpret things your own way, even when he doesn't say you need to. If you're cool with that, you should definitely enjoy his class.","Probably one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken. He doesn't do things normally, and that's what makes his class so much fun."],"courses":["ENGL149","ENGL142","ENGL150","ENGL102","ENGL102","ENGL089","ENGL052","ENGL101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
