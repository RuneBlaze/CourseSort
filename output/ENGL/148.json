You must read the novels and shorts stories he assigns if you want to get a good grade. His quizzes are  very fair and he is a very fair grader on the papers. He was very willing to help students and would even take feedback from students. His discussions are awesome and thought provoking and he's hilarious!","Fletcher made a boring required class into an interesting one. He pretty much let us write about whatever interested us and we even got to spend a class at the Ackland art museum. The class was basically just 2 papers and a short presentation. A lot easier work than other 105 classes from what I've heard.","By far one of the best professors I have had at UNC. He is a great lecturer and really cares about the students understanding the material. You'll have to read, but the poems are relatively short and he makes discussion fun! I would definitely take again.","Really nice professor. Very involved and cares about his subject matter. Tries to be funny and engaging, but sometimes fails. Poetry is just a boring subject.","He's such a great professor! He was really helpful, insightful, and wanted you to understand the material. His humor is great, and that's what I looked forward to most in his class. He does grade papers somewhat hard, but it is fair.","He is super nice and helpful. As long as you put forth a moderate amount of effort you'll do fine.","Great most wonderful excellent teacher. Had him for 101 and 102. Best English teacher hands down. He's funny, helpful, and nice. Highly recommend.","He is the best teacher to get for English 101/102. I liked him so much that I told him for both. He is very helpful and he grades decently. If you try, you'll be fine. He's very funny and engaging. He is one of my favorite teachers.","Excellent professor; grades fairly but kind of tough on papers. Hilarious and entertaining, he makes you look forward to coming to class.","Incredible teacher.  Took the class just for fun and had a blast.  He makes going to class feel like it's worth your time because he makes it truly enjoyable.","I loved this class. It was at 8 AM and I still found myself excited about going!","Quality teacher. Not an easy A, but it is definitely the kind of A that you enjoy working towards. With his entertaining and effective delivery, he is excellent at teaching the works.","Awesome awesome awesome!  Take him for English 101!  He is so funny, easy going, and very helpful! Our class was a blast! I still say hey to him when I see him on campus!","Knows his stuff; absolutely hilarious; grades tough but fair"],"courses":["ENGL123","ENGL105","ENGL125","ENGL125","ENGL123","ENGL102","ENGL101","ENG101","ENGL125","ENGL122","ENGL125","ENGL122","ENGL101","ENGL125"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
