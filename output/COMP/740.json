He has weekly planned quizzes that are impossible to pass though even though they are open-notes and open-textbook. Pay attention in class and you should be okay for the course. Do the homework and lab assignments early, because they are good prep for quizzes. Feel free to ask questions in class.","Montek is one of the best professors in the computer science department. I took COMP 411 and 541 with him. Not only was he able to convey new concepts to me with ease, he also made me very interested in computer architecture and design. He is very helpful in office hours and will work with you when you're struggling with grades. <3 DJ Turbanator","Prof. Montek is the bomb. He really makes you feel like he truly cares about what you get out of the class and how well you understand the material. His office hours are super useful and he is very understanding. His tests/quizzes can be tricky, but they are not too bad. For sure one of the best professors I've had at UNC."],"courses":["COMP411","COMP541","COMP411"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
