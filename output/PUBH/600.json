Not only has she taught me the art and subtle nuances of a superior writing style, her class is wonderfully entertaining and something I look forward to. I've gained invaluable knowledge from her and will miss being her student. She's understanding and reasonable and will always support you.","This was an excellent introduction to the policy and history behind the U.S. health care system. Simply put, the curriculum and teacher were nonpareil.","This professor does not prepare for class, shows up late for class and keeps students late, assigns excessive/irrelevant readings and does not discuss them, and has certain favorite students but takes pride in belittling other students. Her hubris is extremely off-putting."],"courses":["PUBH600","PUBH600","PUBH600"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
