I had him for a FYS so my experience with him would probs be a little different. Easy class that was easy to do badly in because there were only 2 grades and they were moderately difficult papers.","He's not awful but he's not all that great either. The main problem is that the material can be very confusing and the TA's aren't too helpful and neither is the prof, partially that's just because the class is so big though.","He was a horrible explainer and the subject was complicated to begin with. When you asked him for help, he answered you with a question, which was not helpful. Definately not an easy topic and he makes it even harder to understand.","Being German, there are rare occasions where you have to ask him to explain himself, and it can also be difficult sometimes when he explains concepts. Nonetheless, he is a fun, young guy, perfect for teaching this sort of intro course."],"courses":["PHIL078","PHIL155","PHIL155","PHIL20H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"PHIL","catalog_nbr":994,"section":40,"class_nbr":10013,"title":"DOCT RESEARCH AND DISSERTATIONLecture","component":"3","units":0,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"WOLF,SUSAN R","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1270635","fname":"Susan","lname":"Wolf","quality":"2.0","easiness":"3.8","help":"3.8","clarity":"3.8","topTag":"Get ready to read (2)","grade":"3.8","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GET READY TO READ","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["I took FYS Evil and the grading was terrible.  She is very unclear.  I thought I would enjoy this class, but I did not. I would not recommend it at all.  Interesting subject, but terrible execution of  the material.","Professor Wolf is very, very intelligent, and I found her lectures enjoyable and informational for the most part. She expects a lot from her students, so you'll have to work hard for a good grade.","She talks in circles and is extremely bad at communicating what she expects from you. This is an intro. level class and she treated it like we were all upper class psych majors. Seriously, don't bother, especially if you're taking it as a gen ed.","For PHIL 089, you come in thinking it'll be an interesting class, but then you walk out learning almost nothing about evil. She often talks in circles, and her voice is a bit nasaly. It feels pretty much like a BS class.

Inro Philosophy of Science first quarter my freshman year, in fact was the class that made me pursue a philosophy major. Lange is eccentric, brilliant, passionate about his area of study, and always willing to help a student understand.
