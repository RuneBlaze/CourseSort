She is organized. Intelligent. And also very enthusiastic about linguistics. I loved this class and I will def take another class with her.","I'm not a ling major but took Phonetics as my interest. Jen is very organized with clarified learning objectives. A fun prof in the class. But not willing to help during office hours. She makes students fear of herself and linguistics by Pop-quizs and tricky exams. Attendance is not mandatory but once you miss, be ready to talk with her.","Jen is a great professor. She is very enthusiastic and VERY organized. Her course website is awesome and very clear. LING200 with her was pretty easy for me because she lays everything out so logically. Her other courses can be a little more challenging. Of the low level LING courses, 200 and 203 are the best, definitely take them.","One of the least helpful professors I have ever had. Completely taught myself the material. After studying extensively, still did not do well on test. Study guides are no help. Makes trick questions as if she wants you to do poorly. Went to office hours and she would not help at all!","I really enjoyed LING 101H with Dr. Smith even though I'm a physics major and will never become a linguist. She's enthusiastic, caring, and very knowledgeable.","she's really energetic about linguistics, almost a little too much. class was completely boring as she would just read off the outline.","Prof. Smith is a very enthusiastic & caring professor.  She is obviously very interested in linguistics and brings that excitement into the classroom. I really didn't like the subject matter and would have died had it not been for the fact that she was a really good prof.","very nice lady.  linguistics would be boring, but shes very enthusiastic about what she teaches.  not too hard, no pop quizes or anything.","Great class and proffessor, although the recitations were kind of pointless if you were doing well in the class."],"courses":["LING101","LING520","LING200","LING101","LING101","LING101","LING101","LING101","LING30"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"LING","catalog_nbr":993,"section":12,"class_nbr":8726,"title":"MASTER'S RESEARCH AND THESIS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"BECKER,MISHA K","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"LING","catalog_nbr":993,"section":9,"class_nbr":8724,"title":"MASTER'S RESEARCH AND THESIS","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"TERRY,JULES M","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1484892","fname":"Jules","lname":"Terry","quality":"2.9","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"LECTURE HEAVY (1)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY"],"comments":["I found Ling101 very interesting, however Terry was one of the worst professor's I've had. His lectures are extremely boring and he patronizes people who ask questions in class. In fact, the lecturers themselves were useless as I learned all of the material during the weekly recitation.","Professor Terry is a nice guy, willing to help, and he wants you to participate in discussion during lecture.  He wants to make sure you're understanding the material and he cares.  He is passionate about what he is teaching, but the class can be a bit boring at times.  Tests are fair, he gives partial credit, and he is lenient.","He really does enjoy what he's teaching, and the class could be really interesting with that kind of passion, but he's incredibly unorganized.  I made an A because the topics came really easily to me, but if this isn't as easy for you, find a different prof who will make a little more sense.","The class was one that I took on recommendation of a friend and absolutely loved it!! Ive since officially changed to a Linguistics Major because of it. The teacher is pleasant, helpful, and enthusiastic about what he does.

She has trouble clarifying (and basically teaching) concepts. Readings are fundamental-- only way to survive","Professor Pertsova is knowledgable about the information she is teaching but does not necessarily communicate the information effectively. She has lecture slides for the class and seems to fly through the hard material and spend an excessive amount of time on the easy information. Her main goal for the exams is not to test your knowledge of the mat","She's obviously very intelligent, but probably BECAUSE of that doesn't seem to understand why students don't understand things as soon as she explains them. She's terrible at explaining concepts and tends to be pretty disorganized. The material can be interesting and you can probably manage a decent grade, but don't expect her to be much help.","She is a very smart individual, but some people are not born to be teachers.","really easy A and sort of interesting. don't go to lecture, it's not helpful. just read the book and read the lecture powerpoint notes on sakai and you're set. she also gives lots of easy extra credit opportunities, so it's probably in your best interest to do them. i had kline as a TA and he was really good as well","Well, the class is utterly pointless first of all. You might actually do better if you skip  the class in the giant lecture halls, She posts the exact lecture notes on Sakai. Do your best if you take this class; it's hardly ever in your field of study and is a &quot;filler class&quot; that nobody wants.","She is very very nice. The class itself is pretty hard and challenging, but if you go to class and put some time in the readings you'll do fine. She re-explains the readings in class and takes any questions you might have.
