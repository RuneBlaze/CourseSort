Lectures are boring and it's easy to get distracted, they feel unneccessary but don't skip because that might've been a quiz day.  Tests feel too hard compared to the pace of the class but if you study a bit you should be fine","The actual material is very interesting, but the class is not. Lectures are long and boring, but the professor is nice. There was only one homework assignment all semester. The reading is not necessary if you go to class and take good notes. However, if you tend to get bored (as most individuals did), I would recommend renting the textbook.","I have been a student at the UNC for some time now, and I have never had a worse lecturer than Dr. Surge. No doubt that she is remarkably intelligent in her field... However, she is just a terrible lecturer. Literally says \"uhmm\" every other word, and stumbles through her powerpoint. Class is easy, just her lectures will frustrate you read the book","Interesting Person. Go to class, review the power points, do the study guides, get an A. She loves geology and teaching. Attendance is not mandatory and her power points are posted, but still go to class because she gives short easy quizzes and has assignments due you don't want to miss. The class was small so she will notice if you aren't there.","p good","No Comments"],"courses":["GEOL110","GEOL110","GEOL110","GEOL202","GEOL412","GEOG106"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
