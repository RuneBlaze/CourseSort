Very helpful in class and office hours and just a really nice guy in general. Try to take his Biol 451 class if you can!","Amazing class! Professor Kier loves the material and makes it interesting with the use of demos and simple physics. You end up learning the theory and aren't just memorizing.","By far one of the best classes i've taken at unc. he was a great prof and very enthusiastic about the material,which was contagious. the material itself was really interesting. definately recommend this class!"],"courses":["BIOL451","BIOL451","BIOL120"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
