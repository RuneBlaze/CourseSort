She did a good job of making a very boring subject (grammar) pretty interesting. She's prone to go on tangents in class, so be prepared. The class was pretty tough at first, but don't be discouraged because it gets easier. Go to her office hours, she really is there for her students!","Dr. Lee is SO smart and funny.   I was very intimidated after the first day, looking at the syllabus was very overwhelming. We had a paper due on like the third day of class! BUT MAN!!! Once you get used to the work load (which eases up as the semester continues) the class is GREAT!!!! I learned so much and I will take more of her classes.","You can get points taken off for things don't involve your understanding of the material.  Also make sure the Spanish is correct in your papers, the content doesn't matter so much.","Dr. Lee is a cool professor, but can be condescending to all American students. She's traveled a lot and has a lot to share, but puts shame on those who have never been outside the United States and makes you feel ignorant. She's also a pretty funny person too, cracking a joke once in a while. The class was harder than necessary, but still doable..","She is nice and always has interesting stories to tell. But she gives lots of small assignments and pop quizzes that can kill your grade because they are so difficult. She is a good teacher- but spanish 204 is hard and is a huge jump from 203. If coming from high school consider 203 for an easy A.","Quizzes are almost impossible. The information isn't always relevant to what is studied in class. However, she makes the class very enjoyable. She makes you speak in Spanish which is super annoying but helpful! My conversation skills have improved immensely. Just be prepared for hard quizzes and tests. The grammar handbook has examples that help.","Span 102 online- The book is not very helpful IMO because i doesn't give enough examples. That makes actually doing the classwork and homework necessary if you really want to understand the material. Ambiciones Siniestras is ok, if your really good at understanding the long paragraphs and fast talking in videos. Overall, class participation is key.","The worksheets and the PowerPoints were really helpful.  The book was not helpful to me at all.  Ambiciones siniestras went way too quickly for someone who is learning elementary Spanish.  The tests were pretty straightforward, however, if you spelled something wrong or missed an accent mark, you missed the whole question.  Quizzes were helpful.","The videos in the book she uses are sometimes hard to understand and she texts and quizes you on it. There is very little accountability for completing the worksheets which makes you less likely to work on it all week. One class a week is not much either so its easy to put it off. Power points and class are very helpful and cover everything.","The online testsquizzes do not give partial credit and count the answer completely wrong for the smallest mistakes. I liked the worksheets because they helped me follow along with class because I do not work well under pressure of being randomly called on. The professor was very helpful and clear. Overall, great class.","The stuff that helped me within this class was the pronunciation quizzes and powerpoints. The pronunciation quizzes allowed me to see how well I spoke Spanish, which helped a lot. I was thankful the powerpoints were available because sometimes the textbook made the grammar hard to understand but the powerpoints broke it down better.","SPAN 102-Online The powerpoint and worksheets helped me because I could follow along with the class without being put completely on the spot. The videos from the textbook did not help because they went too fast and I could not really understand the story. Unfortunately  testsquizzes do not give partial credit. Overall, I really enjoyed the class.","I had a bad experience with SPAN 204 and SPAN 255 professors and almost began to hate Spanish. However, after having Professor Lee, I've remembered why I love Spanish so much. She's amazing, funny, has a lot of insight on the world through her travels, and a great lecturer. Class is generally difficult, I guess, but she helps you along the way. 55","She's an awesome professor! She has traveled everywhere and can really give you a lot of insight about various countries and interesting facts. If you come to class & try to participate as much as possible, you'll do well. You can tell she loves what she does. The class was at 9am and she was always enthusiastic. She's really sweet. TAKE HER CLASS!","The cultural information provided both before and after the viewing of each movie is very helpful to understanding some of the sayings and humor that appears. It also allows for the student to relate better to the Spanish culture.","Sra. Lee is one of the best professors at UNC. If you have a chance to take a class with her, do it! She genuinely loves her job and that is demonstrated through her teaching. This class does require a significant amount of time outside of class watching movies and completing book exercises.","Professor Lee is great! She is very knowledgable, and always keeps class interesting.","Professor Lee is one of the best Spanish professors I've had at UNC. The content of the class is already really interesting but her comments make it even more enjoyable.","The professor keeps this class interesting with additional information about real life events relating to the movies. Her office hours are flexible and she is available if you need help.","I like this class a lot. Not only is it an advanced level course allowing for fluent conversation in SPanish, the information and history we are learning by watching the films is very interesting.

His tests are pretty tough. I've taken two classes with him (thinking I could pull an A off the second time and got a B+). Oral interview is graded tough and he doesn't give late forgiveness. If you really want to learn Spanish, take his class. Office hours are stellar!!","I did not like professor Kim at all as a teacher.  He is a very nice person but he grades really tough and does not give helpful feedback.  He expects the students to know things that my friend in 203 didn't even know.  His expectations are ridiculous and his exams were the hardest I've ever taken.  My advice: take another professor.","Professor Kim is a great lecturer, but seems to be very unorganized. He is usually very helpful if you go to office hours or come to him with questions in class, but he didn't return any of our assignments on time and fell behind on assigning our oral interviews by an entire week.","While I think Professor Kim is a great teacher for 100-204 Spanish classes, I would caution anyone taking his class for levels 260 or higher. Professor Kim expects a lot from his students and is not very clear in his teachings or instructions to students on assignments.","Great professor. Period.","He is an amazing teacher. Super passionate. If you have questions when you have doubt he will make it clear however he can. Really animated and made class fun. Do outside reading because he discusses everything in class. Office hours are super helpful as well.","Dr. Kim really is a great teacher. He's very passionate about teaching Spanish. He does sometimes make a point when people are wrong, but he doesn't mean to humiliate anyone. He is a good teacher who truly cares that his students learn the material. I would recommend him for 102. (Took it during Summer Session)","U took his hybrid class so I was a little hesitant but it wasn't that bad at all. He really is a nice guy and tries to make the class as interesting as possible. It was shocking how much I learned in a 50 min session. The thing about his class is that everything is evenly distributed so even if you mess up you can make it up. He truly cares!","Not enough speaking. Class did not meet often enough to get a useful grasp on the language. Although English is not his first language, he is easy to understand. Helpful. I strongly dislike the use of online teaching tools - now I can read and write Spanish, but am barely above 101 level in speaking. Very disappointing semester.","He may be OK for 101-204 but I would avoid higher levels with him. He made this class so ridiculously hard. Not to mention boring. And the reviewer who mentioned that he makes a scene when you're wrong about something - spot on. He enjoys pointing out the minutest of his students' mistakes, but the thing is, he makes plenty of them himself! Avoid.","Kim is an okay professor, he is very militant in his teaching style, the main reason I score him low is that when you answer incorrectly he makes a big scene and you feel so dumb for not know the answer. other then that he is a pretty good guy","dr.kim is so passionate about teaching, and it is apparent in his approach. he is quite thorough in his lectures and speaks clearly so that he may be understood. i enjoyed his class a lot - he used powerpoints frequently to coincide with his lectures.i would definitely recommend dr.kim to anyone who wants to become fluent in spanish","He's very animated and loves to teach. Great guy, quite entertaining. The subject matter is kind of a bore, but he tries to make it interesting and fun.","Great professor.  Very enthusiastic, and makes spanish... which i hate, prett fun.  Not a hard professor, there is a midterm, a &quot;mini&quot; midterm, and a final, plus participation and a presentation grade.  An overall nice guy.

I wish I had taken more classes with him.","it was very entertaining having alan as a professor. he is very nice and knowledgable. the class is very laid back","I would say this is definitely the professor to take if you're just trying to finish your FL credit. He makes tests as easy as he can (listening sections) and doesn't assign much homework, especially toward the end of the semester. However, if you want to actually learn Spanish, he's probably not the best choice. He's pretty confusing sometimes","He's very easy. If you're serious about learning Spanish, I'd say that you should opt for someone a little more difficult. If you don't care about learning and just want FL credit, he's the man for you. Very little homework, very easy grading on the tests.","If you take this class and do the work (basic worksheet style), you will pass. This class, however, was awful to sit through. Despite talking in English a LOT, he was still impossible to understand when he taught grammar. Does not finish sentences!! He ended up waxing philosophical the whole time... and being rather rude when students didn't agree.","Prof Re is awesome. He really knows the subject and you can ask him any question. Very flexible and open. He really helps a lot.","Professor Re**** is easy going, very relax and knowledgeable. He doesn't teach much yet he guides well. I only needed a D to graduate and was not planning to study much, however, I did a lot of homework without even being aware. His class was super fun and I learned a great deal. Highly recommend his class!","Redik is a SUPER EASY teacher, and pretty chill. however, he refuses to teach actual spanish. A nice guy, though.","Prof. Re**** is hard. At the first part of the semeste he kills you with homeworks but then you set you free. He lets you work on your own terms. I ended with an A and I was expecting a C+ hen I started. He knows what he is doing.","This is the easiest professor I have ever had at Carolina. HOWEVER, he will not teach you anything. He refuses to help in class and tells people to look up answers online instead. I want to minor in Spanish and if you want to learn at all DO NOT take this class.","Great professor. Very intelligent and extremely knowledgeable. The discussions are highly philosophical and he will help you a lot with your grammar.","Alan is the man. He grades great, but he will teach if you are interested. He helped me out when I asked. He only cares about grammar when you write compositions, not so much subject matter.","Pretty cool guy. The readings are really hard of you are coming from SPAN 204. They are do-able though. He gives a lot of help on what to know for the test so pay attention on review days! Grades pretty easily.","Alan Re**** is the bomb. His class was easy and he really tried hard to help you make good grades. On the downside he can be a bit flighty, so don't expect your papers or tests back anytime soon."],"courses":["SPAN203","SPAN204","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN260","SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN204","SPAN204","SPAN350","SPAN203","SPAN260","SPAN105"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":203,"section":34,"class_nbr":3062,"title":"INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0410","days":"MWF","time":"13","instructor":"Valparis,Amaia","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["FL"],"enrl_cap":19,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":4,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2080080","fname":"Amaia","lname":"Valparis","quality":"4.5","easiness":"2.5","help":"2.5","clarity":"2.5","topTag":"Participation matters (2)","grade":"2.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["CARING","CARING"],"comments":["She is literally the best.

Extremely hard on participation grades - didn't let me \"make up\" credit when I was in the HOSPITAL (though I did end up with a 90, after going to class every single time afterwards and participating my ass off). However she is fluent and gives great info.","She is a pretty strict grader, especially compared to the other SPAN 203 teachers. She does not explain why she marks off most of the time when you ask her. She also marks down on the entire class for participation grade, which should be an automatic A if you pay attention and show up to class. However, she does not treat it like this.","I thought the class was really easy. Especially for the 4th level of college spanish. yeah she gives a lot of quizzes but they are incredibly easy. she tests and grades really fairly. the assignments are pretty easy too. she isn't the most helpful professor but she is nice and you should pull an A or B with little effort","The reading is what's killer--expect a fair amount of homework every night. The analyzing isn't that bad once you get used to it, but if you don't pay attention in class you're screwed on the tests! Expect questions on exact quotations, themes, authors, time periods, cultural differences between countries, etc.","Assigns a lot of homework, especially nights before tests, so on top of studying for an exam, you have to worry about doing the assignments. Quizzes and in class essays almost everyday in class. Impractical grading scale-do better on in class rough draft comps verses final drafts. Does not make herself accessible for outside help. Avoid this class!","She's really nice and the class is pretty easy, especially if you have a good background in Spanish and can put together a half-decent essay. I think its as interesting as you make it- if you read and think about it, class is a lot more interesting because you will have more to add.","She's a mediocre teacher. She's good about sensing whether or not class is ready for upcoming tests, etc. and she'll change dates around. Do the homework. She's not that easy, but at this level, easiness shouldn't really be expected. Overall, the class isn't that bad.","She is a good teacher but she is not an easy one. If you want to continue on further in spanish then take her.","She's a fair grader and will postpone quizzes or speak in English if she can tell the class isn't doing well.  She's cool.","No Comments"],"courses":["SPAN203","SPAN203","SPAN204","SPAN260","SPAN204","SPAN21","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN3","SPAN003"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","POOR"]}},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":203,"section":951,"class_nbr":11812,"title":"INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Dey Hall","room":"0401","days":"TuTh","time":"18","instructor":"Alexander,Martha Elizabeth","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["FL"],"enrl_cap":22,"enrl_tot":11,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null},{"subject":"SPAN","catalog_nbr":203,"section":990,"class_nbr":11885,"title":"INTERMEDIATE SPANISH I","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":null,"load":"99.97 Instructor","rank":"INST","attributes":["FL"],"enrl_cap":15,"enrl_tot":15,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":null}]
