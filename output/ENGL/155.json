She thinks her opinion is the only one that matters. If you offer a differing point of view or even just ask for clarification about an assignment, she will yell at your in front of the entire class. I once had a panic attack on the way to her class.","Dr. Crystall is by far the worst English teacher I have had in my education experience so far.  She is extremely vague, unhelpful, close minded, and disrespectful. I can't say I have ever enjoyed her class or her as a professor. Please avoid taking her class, no matter what it takes. The course work isn't hard but she is my least favorite professor","AVOID taking this class. She is very vague spacey, but manages to get snappy and angry when students make mistakes. I sat next to a slower boy in class, and she ripped into him often (cutting him off sharp tone eye rolling). SO RUDE!!  If you take it, buckle down, do your very best work, and always cover your butt by taking the extra mile.","Very closed minded/arrogant. I have seen her attempt to make students look foolish for questioning the vagueness of an assignment. Avoid at all costs. I would bet good money that she wrote the 2 positive reviews about herself.","Her assignments were very confusing and she was unclear about her expectations. She could be rude sometimes. She found no issues with any of my papers and I made As on everything, but I would really have valued some instruction there, as I really didn't know how to write college papers as a first-semester freshman.","Dr. Crystall was very unclear with most of her assignments. I'd recommend to avoid any class you have with her.","Really disliked Dr. Crystall mainly because of how unclear she was with all of her assignments. I'd suggest to not take any of her classes.","she is not a good teacher and does not respect others opinons.","If you are looking for a really easy class to fill your LA credit, TAKE ENGL 124!!! It's about graphic novels, which are essentially comic books.  Not only is it an easy grade, but the material is fun to read. Not a lot of effort needed. Two papers, two group discussions, a midterm, and a final. Great class, wonderful prof!!","If you have to rearrange your schedule not to take her class, do it.  It's worth it, trust me.  So mean and so stubborn.  A total headache.","No Comments","As previously stated, this woman does believe that her opinion is the only opinion.  As a very liberal person myself, politically and socially, I find her liberal bias in the classroom unnecessary and limiting to her young students.  She is SOOO politically correct that it makes real debate and dialogue in the classroom impossible.","She is an old lady that seems to be stuck in the past...She is strict, and makes me feel like I am in high school again..i feel very restricted in class. I wouldn't recommend her.  Hint:reasearch her name on the internet.....","a great teacher; entertaining and lively in class, kept discussion going; very tolerant of all points of view, even when we discussed controversial issues","Great professor. Very compassionate.","Not the best professor, but not the worst. She has her favorite students, just be willing to participate in class and show that you are intersted in her class. She is a fairly easy essay grader!","Why she is still teaching is a mystery to me.  Should've been canned a long time ago.  Freedom of speech for me, but not for thee.  Hypocrite.","Good lord, no!","booooooo...terrible","No Comments"],"courses":["ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGLISH105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL101","ENGL124","ENGL102","MULT101","ENG2163","ENGL","ENG101","ENG023","ENGL11","ENG101","ENG","ENG11","EN"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL"]}}]
