This class had a very specific focus that made it very intellectually stimulating, but at times kind of alienating. The material can feel very dense at first, but with a little effort everything becomes pretty comprehensible. Plus, he hammers in his key points well. Make sure you go to class though!!","This professor seems very nice, and when he teaches the material you feel like you know it.  The problem occurs when he talks to you in private. He constantly condescends you, and acts as though you are the one making the mistakes, even if you are asking for helps.  I have never been talked to by a professor this way.  I would not recommend him.","he's really nice and wants you to learn the material. attendance isn't mandatory, but i recommend it since he basically tells you what he wants you to know. no book - just articles he posts on blkboard. added points to our midterm grade to encourage attendance, which is worth it even thought the class is at 8am. not terribly hard or easy either."],"courses":["PSYC469","PSYC463","PSYC463"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
