There's no HW, 1 map quiz of Africa, a book summary, a 10pg research paper, and midterm/final. She gives guides, which you should fill out and study for exams.","Dr. Lisanza is one of the best professors I have had at UNC. She is super nice, approachable, and makes lecture fun. Every once in a while she's a little unclear or confusing, but if you ask she will 100% clear it up. She's a great professor, really cares about the subject, and has cool anecdotes for every topic. Overall awesome and easy","Mwalimu Esther is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She'll teach you songs and have you play games that make it easy to learn Swahili. The book was not the greatest in quality but it doesn't really matter because Esther puts all of her own notes and lessons online that better explain everything. She's hilarious though and it's an easy A!"],"courses":["AAAD101","AAAD101","SWAH401"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
