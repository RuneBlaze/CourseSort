I am currently taking 377 with her, and am basing my class choices for next semester off of what classes she is teaching. She is easily approachable, and is willing to help out students. She is lenient with the due dates for reading forums, as she understands that we are students with busy lives. WOULD RECOMMEND!!!","Lots of reading and spends most of the class lecturing about said reading. A little bit confusing as to what she's looking for so students hesitate to speak and the class ends up being awkwardly quiet. Still, she really appreciates when students participate and as long as you do the assignments and speak in class she grades pretty generously.","Dr. Fisher is AMAZING. This is the third class I'm taking with her and she is the reason I'm taking the course! Regardless of what class you take with her, you WILL come out with a good grade if you just attend class! Her classes always have a presentation, 2 papers and final essay. She doesn't take off points for grammar & is super nice & helpful!","Prof. Fisher is the best French prof at UNC. She is up to date when it comes to current topics in French but she is still able to teach obscure 19th century texts. I love her!","I've taken two of her classes and she's a little boring, but the topics are very relevant and she does a thorough job with them. 2 papers, a presentation and a final. Lots of movies and a decent amount of reading, but you can get by with just skimming and paying decent attention in class."],"courses":["FREN377","FREN372","FREN372","FREN504","FREN077"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
