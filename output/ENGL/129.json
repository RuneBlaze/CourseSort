The class was extremely unorganized and in the span of two days we had 18 pages of writing assigned to us simply because she could not keep up with her earlier deadlines. Although she is certainly intelligent, she shows no signs of making her class a priority. DO NOT TAKE","She is very smart, but sometimes too much for the good of the class. Never returns papers that are assigned, and moved around deadlines and assignments because she took so long grading papers. The class on a day to day basis was discussion. You have to keep up with the reading because she randomly calls on students!","She is very smart but doesn't convey the material well. Some of the things she taught didn't seem relevant to what the class was supposed to be about. When she spoke to you it seemed like she was speaking down to you. She had an arrogant air about her when she talked and it made me wary/ uncomfortable to go to her for help.","Dr. Fisher is intelligent, and expects a TON from her students.  I think that the course load was extremely high for a first-year seminar.  Also, Dr. Fisher is not an easy grader by any stretch of the imagination.  If you are a freshman looking for a stress-free seminar, this might not be the one for you.  Although, you would certainly learn a lot!","Like others have said, she's a very intelligent and well spoken woman. I definitely learned a lot from her. I do think she expects too much and grades papers hard. You cannot miss more than 2 classes without having your grade lowered & you MUST keep up with readings because she will call on anyone at anytime.","took Intro to Literary Criticism with her and was blown away. Her class is intense - you're very much expected to participate, so you better keep up with the readings. She's a brilliant professor and incredibly well spoken, and she definitely wants her students to succeed. Try to take a class with her if you can!","Dr. Fisher was an amazing teacher - incredibly smart (almost too smart) and interesting, but I found the courseload way too high for a first year seminar. I learned a lot and I think I'm a better writer because of the class, but if you're interested in her class be prepared to write a TON."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL129","ENGL128","ENGL86","ENGL283","ENGL261","ENGL086"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":129,"section":5,"class_nbr":13398,"title":"LIT/CULTURAL DIVERSITY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0302","days":"TuTh","time":"09","instructor":"COLEMAN,JAMES W","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":33,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=623596","fname":"James","lname":"Coleman","quality":"2.6","easiness":"2.6","help":"2.6","clarity":"2.6","topTag":"Get ready to read (2)","grade":"2.6","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY","SKIP CLASS? YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["Personally, I found this class to be one of my favorites I've taken at UNC.  We read some really great material; and he goes over it in class.  Attendance is mandatory, but participation is not so it's okay to skip some readings.  Class is very chill, kinda boring sometimes, but really great discussion balances that out.  Highly recommend.","There's four grades in the class: midterm, final, semester-long essay, and attendance. He takes roll every time. Lectures SUPER boring. I've fallen asleep in class 3 times and I've never done that before. Easy class, though. Just show up and read the materials. I didn't read any of the novels (only the short stories) and got a B- still.","Strange person.  He puts on this semi-buffoonish shtick at times to sort of act dumb, and he dances around with these verbal shuffles of &quot;ah.. well, ah...&quot; like he doesn't know what he's really saying.  But when he's reading an emotional passage or telling it straight, you can just tell that he's a really deep guy.  Recommended for English majors.","Extremely dull professor whose lectures are little more than re-reading sections of the novel.  The course is a joke, and he offers little insight into the novels.  The exams are both split between character and quotations identifications and a very broad essay.  Read the novels and you do fine, but do not expect to gain anything from the class.","he enjoys prepared students who participate in class. if you have a question for him, go to office hours. make sure you have given the answer some thought before you go becuause he can tell if you don't.","It's amazing that this guy is teaching English when he barely speaks it. Often used words in the wrong context and even made up words (see: thematisizes). I would find his ignorance amusing if I wasn't tortured by his incredibly boring lectures.","great teacher. passionate about the works. Teaches with clarity and provides valuable insight.","I took him for two classes because for some reason I thought that he was less boring than my other English professors.  I'm not sure that I think that he really reads the papers.  It seems like everyone pretty much got the grade that they made on their midterm as their final grade.  He can be funny however act a little elitist.","Hideously boring professor. Is willing to read drafts of intro paragraphs only when you're preparing the course paper. However, he did seem to grade fairly easily.","No Comments","This class was as exciting as watching paint dry.","He's clearly not very smart, but compensates for this deficit with sheer arrogance.  Rude, rude, rude.","oh yuck! so i'm pretty sure he curves considering i came out with a B- and i completely bombed the final and got a C on the midterm but i would rather smash my hand in a car door than sit through another one of his classes.. he takes attendance and i can understand why b/c no one would be there if he didn't! booooring and hard","Very disappointing. Takes potentially enthralling material and makes it unbearably dull. Lectures were disjointed, confusing, and incredibly boring (and he takes attendance!). He is unclear about his expectations but grades harshly.","I thought Coleman was going to be a great prof, but he ended up being the most boring lecturer and a harsh grader. Although I made a C+ on the midterm, I ended up with an A- in the class. If you can hang in there and get through the boring lectures (he takes attendence) then you might end up with a good grade."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL129","ENGL345","ENGL369","ENGL369","ENGL368","ENGL369","ENGL085","ENGL82","ENGL845","ENGL82","ENGL","ENGL22","ENGL85","ENGL82"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL"]}},{"subject":"ENGL","catalog_nbr":129,"section":2,"class_nbr":13402,"title":"LIT/CULTURAL DIVERSITY","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"Greenlaw","room":"0319","days":"MWF","time":"10","instructor":"FLANAGAN,KATHLEEN T","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["LA"],"enrl_cap":35,"enrl_tot":34,"wait_cap":5,"wait_tot":3,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=623599","fname":"Kathleen","lname":"Flanagan","quality":"4.4","easiness":"2.2","help":"2.2","clarity":"2.2","topTag":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK (3)","grade":"2.2","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["SKIP CLASS?

The paper may be very long but as long as you keep up with the readings you will be fine.","Never been a fan of English 105. That being said, it was still an enjoyable class. She breaks up essays into a paragraph/night sort of homework assignment. Make sure to check the assignments before every class! Homework is due every class day. Otherwise, a good professor and kind grader.","Kathleen is very granola, and a little bit older, but she's a lot more organized than the other ENGL 105 \"professors\" (TAs). That's an advantage, for me, at least, that she's an actual professor. There was more work than some of the other English classes, but it paid off in the end. Just turn in the work that she asks for, use staples, and ur good.","Professor Flanagan was a great professor! I didn't like her a lot at first, but if you seek the effort and get to know her better, she's extremely intelligent, very sweet, and always helpful. She grades very fairly; if you put forth the effort, you'll get the grade you deserve.","Professor Flanagan is a very good professor. She is very sweet and breaks down all the work into one to two paragraphs as homework. She grades fairly and pretty easily.","Dr. Flanagan is really into Pacific culture, and she's very well-informed on the cultures the class covers. The workload is manageable, and the midterm and final are fair. From what I've seen, most people receive similar grades on tests and papers (mostly in the A-B range). Class is treated like a seminar, so read the books at your own pace!","Started off pretty interesting but took a nose-dive after the second novel. Be aware that there is a considerable amount of poetry involved. Attendance mandatory and she uses the entire class time ALWAYS. Rather boring and EVERY work we read had gratuitous amounts of sexual themes; some borderline pederasty and others were outright incestuous.","She is a terrible teacher, easily the hardest grader in her department. If you want to make the deans list don't take this class, English 101 is to easy of a class to risk taking this professor. Good Luck.","Great Professor! Really nice and teaches class in a relaxed and fun way. I took two classes with her. One midterm & final(both: identification and an essay). Reading notebook (about 1/ 2 weeks), some reading but very interesting books. one 4-5 paper","Dr. Flanagan is a great teacher. she is really interested in the material and presents it in a fun and educational manner. Her classes were not very hard ( I had her for English 10, too), but I always enjoyed them. There is a fair amount of reading but it's well worth it!","YOU HAVE TO DO POSTS ON BLACKBOARD & THERE ARE NO TESTS OTHER THAN THE MIDTERM & FINAL & A COUPLE OF EASY POP QUIZZES IN B/W.  THIS CLASS WAS MOSTLY DISCUSSION & IT WAS MY EASISET  CLASSES. TAKE HER IF U CAN. THERES ALOT OF READING BUT I HONESTLY DIDNT READ ALL THE BOOKS/ARTICLES WE WERE ASSIGNED & I GOT AN 'A'.","Flanagan is such a nice professor. She expects quality from her students and a lot of reading, but she is leniant on grading and a pleasure to have as a teacher."],"courses":["ENGL129","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL129","ENGL141","ENGLI101","ENGL129","ENG22","ENGL022","ENGL92C"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
