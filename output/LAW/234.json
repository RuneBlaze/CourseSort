He stimulates class discussion very well and encourages participation. He is approachable and friendly. His office door is always open to students with questions, although he expects to answer a substantive question, not to rehash or explain the basic law.","Great class. Exactly what I expected from law school. I look forward to taking him again in the future.","Not always clear, not always helpful but what a great lecturer!","Class consists of nothing more than normative discussions about what the law should be.  Prof. Marshall is abrasive, sarcastic, and doesn't hide his disdain for students.  Great subject, terrible class."],"courses":["CIVPRA","CIVPRA","CIVP210","FIRSTAMENDMENT"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
