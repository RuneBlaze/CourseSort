His lectures consist of relevant course material connected with current events, wit and humor that make for both an entertaining and informative lecture. You honestly won't want to miss it, he is so well spoken and passionate about his field. The class is difficult, but well worth the work.","Professor is clearly a genius and very passionate about the subject.  However, Naiden is a very disorganized lecturer and you never know what he is important and what isn't. Tons of reading, at least 30 pgs of textbook per class. The 2 midterms and a final plus six essay assignments, which are hard because of his bad lecturing skills.","This class was SO hard! He rambles on about nothing to do with the readings or the slides on the power point- he doesn't even know how to work it properly. None of the hw content is discussed in class, it is so confusing and jambled. Tests are hard and the TAs grade the papers very harshly.  Struggled to pass this but got all  As in other classes.","He gives good lectures but is not the teacher to go to for office hours and even told me to drop the class when I became concerned about it","Professor Naiden is a scholar of high quality. If you want to learn ancient Greek history at Carolina, this is the person who knows more about than anyone else here. If you want to be babied DON'T take this class, but if you are driven and really want to learn the topic, this is the class for you. Would not recommend to non classics/history majors.","As said, Dr. Naiden is a top notch scholar with a seemingly photographic memory for Greek history. However, his lectures are the least organized and most confusing/ineffective I have ever experienced in 4 years of college. Expect to teach yourself everything, read book like the bible, and hope your TA can clarify the mush that will be your brain.","Naiden clearly knows his stuff. He is the eccentric genius type and it's evident that he's very passionate about what he's teaching. However, he has a tendency to plunge into a topic that is hard to follow. His powerpoints do not match what he's saying. If you read the book and pay attention in recitation, you should be fine.","He is a very geeky guy, but you can tell he loves what he's teaching. He's always willing to help if you have questions or need something clarified. He's very clear in what he will test on and what he's looking for.","Very strange mannerisms, and his lecture style was a bit... abrupt (?) and yet also kinda boring at the same time. Exams were your standard blue book essays, and some of the prompts for longer papers were a bit weird... Not a horrible class though.","Covers nothing of significance in class but requires attendance anyway. He is not very approachable, and was rude when I tried to speak with him.The midterms were not difficult in nature, but because he doesn't provide any study guide and they require a lot of detail they can be difficult to study for.

His lectures are packed with information, so if you want to do well, definitely pay attention and come to class.  Being all new to Roman history, it was challenging to grasp the names and events.  But Talbert's accent and sense of humor helped get me through!","Professor Talbert is such an awesome professor! It's very clear to see his passion, and it seems as if he knows everything possible about the history of Rome. His expectations are very reasonable and the TA's were great as well. Sometimes the lectures were a little boring, but he randomly cracked jokes throughout which made it so much better.","Talbert is awesome. He is very entertaining in lecture, his British accent helps, and knows what he is talking about. He is clearly quite knowledgeable about Rome, and is quite enthusiastic. This class isn't terribly difficult, 5 short papers and 2 tests, but it is difficult to get an A. I highly recommend Talbert!","Talbert lectures in a narrative imbued with his signature dry humor. Lectures were very easy and enjoyable to follow. All in all, the class is very straightforward. You'll barely touch the textbook, but you do need to do the readings for each recitation and paper. Go to class, take notes, study, and you'll do fine.","I hate history but Talbert made Ancient History intriguing! My TA graded very harshly though and the readings for the 5 papers sucked. Otherwise you never have to read the textbook but to do well on the test you must attend every lecture and write down everything he says.","LOVED this class! He is so entertaining and there's never a dull moment! You can tell that he knows what he's talking about and loves what he does. The quizzes are actually trickier than the tests. You have 5 papers, and its easy to get at least a B on them. The TAs tend to grade a little harsh.","Richard Talbert is God. You must take his class with this in mind. Write down everything he has to say and watch the letters turn to shimmering gold script. Also study the textbook, he wrote it.","LOVED this class. History is not my forte and it was one of my favorite classes. Really engaging lecture. A lot of work, but totally worth it. TAKE. THIS. CLASS.","Very interesting lectures, has an awesome British accent/sense of humor. However, I made the mistake of going in to his office hours once, and let me say I have NEVER met a professor that gave off such an air of arrogance. Dismissive if not condescending to \"lowly\" undergraduates, but otherwise the course is quite nice.","Talbert is one of the best professors I've had at Carolina. I definitely recommend this class!","Prof. Talbert is a great professor with a good sense of humor and a very effective teaching style. His lectures are interesting and easy to understand. The class was a bit harder than I thought it would be. The TAs were tough graders and expected a lot of depth and analysis. Only had 50 min for exam essays and 2page papers.","Awesome prof! I honestly can't say enough how interesting he made his class, there was at least one good laugh a day. There are 6 short (2pg) papers graded by the TAs. 2 tests and a final, study past test. Attendance is kind of mandatory if you want the luxury of being bumped up a letter grade. Recitations almost killed me though, TAs are hardcore.","I've had Prof. Talbert for two classes now (226 and 106) and he is fantastic! Be sure to brush up on British idioms before you take his class, however (nerd= jerk, not geek) and prepare to take a lot of notes.  His exams are tricky but if you do the work, you should be fine.  All the grading is done by TAs, though, so be careful about that.","I loved this class!  I like history anyway, but even if you don't you'll fid him entertaining.  If you put forth the effort then you'll do well.  His lectures are very easy to listen to and comprehend.  Definitely take this class.  The readings on the syllabus help, but honestly I think his test/quiz material is very dominantly from his lectures.","He is a wonderful professor, and he definitely knows what he is talking about!  I would highly recommend taking a class with him!  Some reading is neccessary, but for the most part if you show up and take notes then you should know the material!","Great lecturer.  Every speech is made from memory.  TAs are pretty hard graders, but just keep good notes and you should be fine.","I never once cracked a book. Just study the notes, and ESPECIALLY his previous tests...all questions come from those! I loved the class, the papers weren't the greatest things because they weren't always related to test questions, but the class is well worth taking!","this guy is like watching a discovery channel special on the history of the Roman Empire.  He is an expert in his field and he makes his class very interesting, kept my attention throughout.  i touched the book once but you'll realize as long as you take notes it's obsolete to read his book. STUDY his past exams, he always pulls from them.","Charismatic, knowledgible, fun! Helps to like history!","Great professor!!! History of Rome with Talbert of my favorite classes at UNC by far. Entertaining British accent and one of the most intelligent and knowledgable people in the world on the subject, but doesn't teach the class at a too high level.

You must read all books, if you want to pass test. Also he is very serious about plagiarism. the work he checked by plagramme  plagiarism checker.","Dr. Whalen is a great professor. He really knows his stuff and is very excited to be teaching it. He structures the class so it does not burden you too much. However, the assignments do not have clear grading criteria. Overall, a great class though and I would definitely recommend.","Dr. Whalen is a very passionate professor who is always enthusiastic about teaching his class. Although his focus (at least for Medieval History) was mainly on the Church (an important part of Medieval History) and not much at all on castles and knights (what most people take Medieval History hoping to learn about), he keeps class upbeat and fun.","Professor Whalen did a great job.  He's energetic, articulate and always gives a thoughtful and well prepared lecture.  He gets the billing as the cutest professor in Christendom!","He takes attendance every single despite it being a lecture class but it is worth going to class everyday. He seems like he will be tough at first but he is super animated with lecture and uses all kinds of guides and tools to make the lectures super interesting. Definitely a class worth taking even if you don't like history.","Loved the class, the documentary he showed that he was in was awesome!","I took this class just to get rid of a Gen Ed, yet I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it, all because of Whalen. Medieval History is not an easy subject and the class requires that you take notes, study, and read A LOT, but Whalen is the most inspiring teacher I have had.  His passion and his genuine desire to see students succeed is incredible!","Brett really cares about Medieval History! His passion for his subject is the strongest of any professor I have encountered at UNC.  Attendance in recitation AND lecture is mandatory and taken daily. Everything is graded by TAs, so subjectivity often arises. It is a tough class but not impossible! It satisfies great general education requirements.","Dr. Whalen taught my undergraduate research seminar for my history degree and I would not have wanted anyone else. He's funny, engaging and super helpful. He genuinely wants to see his students succeed and gets so excited when you're doing well. Incredibly smart- he knows what he's talking about. One of Carolina's best. Take him if you can!","Professor Whalen is one of the best professors that I've had at UNC.  His passion for the medieval period is contagious (and I hated history going into the class).  He makes boring subject matter extremely funengaging, but you do have to work for your grade.  There is a lot of reading and lots of participation is expected.","I had Whalen for an honors course on medieval apocalyptic thought, his specialty. The readings were  dry but he makes up for it in lectures--he's engaging, funny, and brilliant. He grades fairly (not harshly)--your grade equates to how much effort you put in. He values student discussion and input. Overall, an amazing prof-take a class with him!","GREATEST. Professor Whalen is extremely excited about medieval history, and wants you to be as well. You must go to class and be typing notes nonstop, but his lectures are very interesting. Tests and papers are very straightforward, and a lot of your grade is participation. Hate history, but one of the top 3 classes I've had at Carolina!","Dr. Whalen is awesome!!! Funny, kind, fascinating lecturer, very helpful and accessible. Lots of reading, but reasonable amount of writing. Not an easy class, but definitely worth it. I hate history but I loved this class!","Great lecturer, but acts like you don't have any other classes to worry about. At least an hour of reading to do for every class period. Essays due way too often. Not to mention having an essay due on Friday and then a test the following Monday. Like I said, great lecturer, but way too much work for an intro level class.","Great professor, if you have the chance, take his class. Super helpful.","Absolute best professor. He's very concerned with his students understanding the material, he's a fascinating lecturer, and he's very clear about what he wants.","Prof. Whalen is one of the most interesting professors I have had at UNC. He is passionate about Medieval History and is fun to listen to. His lectures are always engaging, he is always cheerful and so excited about lecture you can't help but enjoy the class. The class is not the easiest but if you hit the books you should be fine.","Prof. Whalen is great, his class is always really interesting and fun to go to. If you have a chance to take his class, DO IT. As far as history classes go, this one is definitely one of the best Ive ever had.","Professor Whalen is an outstanding teacher, plain and simple.

Do not take Hist 151 for an easy A.  I think there might have been 6 As this semester out of 150 or so. But I worked hard and got an A so it's not impossible.","Really nice guy. His lectures can be a little boring and he talks quietly so it can be hard to hear him, but overall the material is interesting. TAs have a lot of control over grade so easiness depends on them; assignments aren't too bad though, take-home midterm essays, a relatively easy final, and some easy MC quizzes.","I have never been able to stay awake though an entire one of his classes.

Didn't do much of anything for the class and still pulled out a B.","He's very easy to listen to and he really does make class time go pretty quickly.

Loved Dr. Jarausch!","I enjoy his lectures, he has a great sense of humor.  But I feel the tests are geared towards the book... which I didn't read.  But overall, if you read the book and are prepared to study massive amounts of terms for only a couple to be put on the test, you'll be absolutely fine.","Very hard to pay attention in class.  Seems to want to wander off topic, just gives huge list of words @ semesters end and picks 5 random ones to put on the test.  Made me not enjoy history nearly as much as I used to.","Granted, he is very knowlegable, but his lectures ramble and it's hard to see the points he tries to make. I found it very hard to pay attention in lecture. The textbook is difficult reading (I thought) and some TAs are better than others. Some of them would give lectures when Jarausch wasn't in the country.","A lot of people like this professor. Personally, this was my least favorite class that I've ever had at UNC. If you already know some European Hist, you will prolly enjoy this professor. But, if you don't know hardly any Euro Hist prior to his class, good luck!","Sit close to the front because his thick German accent can be hard to decipher at times.  But he is a really great lecturer.  Powerpoints are easy to follow along.  He has a good sense of humor about Germany too.  And recitation sucks but if you go and contribute a few things to the discussion you're bound to get a decent grade.","I thought this class was amazing. Not only did Jarausch have a sense of humor, but his lectures were fascinating. I would take this class over again in a heartbeat.","I would take this class again. He invites a local Holocaust survivor to come in and speak for a day in class- its one of the most rewarding lectures I have ever had at UNC. Accent can be difficult, but hes very knowledgeable and really has well thought out classes. Tests are straightforward, but graded by hit-or-miss TAs.","Jarausch is great.  He is extremely knowledgeable which is apparent through his lectures.  I would suggest sitting in the front, as he is best understood (German accent) by those sitting close.  The topic is interesting, especially for someone like me who enjoys European history.  I would only complain about the recitations & you have to read a LOT","If you have any interest in European history, this is a great class to take.  He is very well respected within the academic community and that is obvious through his lectures.  The lectures aren't boring if you can get past the accent and if you have any interest at all.","No Comments","Top notch. Well known and respected in the historical academic community. If you're interested in Euro history, mark his course as a must. If not, I could see how his lectures could become a bit tedious.","Interesting and funny.  Not difficult to follow if you know a bit about European history.","Great professor, probably among the best (in terms of qualifications in their field) at UNC. His lectures can be somewhat hard to understand, due to his accent, but you'll definitely get something out of taking his class.

Great guy and professor, but he has the TAs grade stuff absurdly hard. So if you're looking for an easy A, he's not your guy.

There's about 20 - 50 pages to read a week but it's not on the test so basically optional. He gives interesting antedates but normally you don't have to write them down so it's not hard to take notes.

He made the course very pleasant.  The lectures did get a bit redundant (partly because there was so much material to cover), but he did a good job keeping things interesting.  Kramer does a good job teaching but TA's grade harshly.  I still came out with a B+.","Dr. Kramer is definitely one of the best professors at UNC and made me consider becoming a history major. He keeps his lectures interesting and his passion for the course material is inspiring. He is really funny too and you should definitely take a history course with him.","Excellent Professor, he was extremely helpful and made the classes interesting.  All you need to watch out for are the TA's (they grade pretty hard)","Great, funny, engaging professor. One of the best at UNC- its professors like him who convinced me to major in history. For a huge survey class, the lectures are well done and tests are pretty straightforward (but graded by TAs). If you need, or even just want, a history class, you cannot go wrong with Kramer.","BEST history teacher I have ever had.  I have never really enjoyed history before but Kramer makes it enjoyable.  Lectures are enjoyable and class goes by quickly.  You won't regret having a class with him.","awesome teacher! if you, like me, are not too thrilled about history but have to take one for your perspective, this is the guy you want! made history lectures funny and interesting! tests are not too hard but the grading is a little strict. also, if you go to every lecture and take good notes, there is no point in buying the textbook.","good lectures, easy tests graded by crazy hard TAs","very good!","BORING BORING BORING","Hilarious and brilliant.  The best professor you will ever have in your miserable little life.","I agree with the reviewer above.  It's been almost 3 years since I had his class but I think he was the best teacher I had at UNC.","This guy is amazing. He is humorous and respectful. It is obvious that he cares about his students.

He is very articulate and I found him very helpful and supportive whenever I asked him about something.

Too much work required for this class for the level it is and none of it is enjoyable. Grading was harsh, multiple long papers.","His fuzzy head (and chest mind you) can distract you from his digressions.

The sections are great because of the engaged TA's.","No Comments","Brillant professor, finally a challenge after breezing through high school.

I also had to deal with some really terrible TA that just made the class worse.","Very interesting teaching style.  No powerpoints, just straight from the hip and well knowledged.  Definitely will have to do all the readings as the exams will be based on them.","Lectures were very interesting, one of the best lecturers at UNC.  Tests are specific and difficult if your not prepared with the small details, but this is the case with many history classes.  Would recommend, but make sure you remember the terms he gives because your grade depends on it.","Professor Glatthaar's class is great. He teaches history from a fun facts and stories perspective so you don't have to be a history major to enjoy/do well in the class. Readings are interesting and reasonable, lectures are fascinating. He can be mildly offensive sometimes but I found it funny. Great class!","He is awesome! Very humorous and keeps class interesting.","Great Professor! He is absolutely one of the best professors at UNC and one of the best professors in the United States. One of the graduate students told me that he is known nationally. Even if you don't like history, take him! His average is a B, which at UNC means EXCELENTE!!! Also, he is very pleasant around students. Take Glatthaar!!!","Great professor. Going to class is a must & it really shows off if you do.  He's actually very friendly and will remember your face from class even if you don't speak. However, with 4 TAs doing all the grading, grading wasn't standardized. Also, Glatthaar sometimes shows his hotheadedness when things don't go his way. Overall an interesting class.","I liked Glatthaar.  Sometimes he was a little too opinionated...remember, it's history.  He was very knowledgeable about his subject and really seemed to enjoy teaching it to us.  Kind of liked how there was no textbooks, we just read 5 small novels.  However, he didn't allow laptops.  If you're good about takin notes & following a lecture take him","Great professor. He holds class the entire time, but his lectures are well worth it. A bit intimidating at first, but kind and helpful. No textbook, but the assigned novels are interesting and complement the material well. I highly recommend, even for anyone who doesn't like history. One of my favorite classes so far at Carolina.","LOVED Joe Glatthaar. I took him when he was at University of Houston.  He's a fascinating guy with tremendous life experience and wisdom!  Take him and you will learn to love history if you don't already!","He is wonderful! Very interested in the subject matter, and excited to be teaching it.  I thought history was ok, but he made it live! I would recommend him to anyone! No textbook, but novels to read that are interesting.  Also, he's funny and very lively.","I enjoyed his class so much in 128 that I wanted to take another history class of his (368)since I needed one. His lectures are never boring and he tells funny anecdotes that make class interesting. No textbook use, but lots of novels that you definitely should read. Tests are not terrible, about half fill-in and half essay. REALLY knows his stuff.","I have never enjoyed history until I took his class. He's a great teacher, and I learned a lot, but I only got a C+...","Funny guy who makes the huge US history survey course interesting. Sadly TAs will do all the grading and it can be really hit or miss. Then again thats the same for just about every big class like this one. Glatthaar is a pretty good teacher though, if you can deal with an occasionally irreverent style I'd recommend the class.","I really liked him as a teacher and would recommend his class but the grading is really dependent upon your TA. I found his lectures interesting and if you take notes, the tests are easy. The outside novels aren't that bad to read.","Amazinggggggg teacher. I adore the class. Tests are easy, just review the lecture notes (go to lecture) and my TA was extremely kind and fair in grading. He goes a bit fast in lecture but lets out early. Be prepared to read historical novels, but rarely any use of the history textbook! I recommend it.","Lectures rambled.  Grading was arbitrary.  Professor was rude to students, and he said anyone who disagreed with his opinions was an idiot (I kid you not).  He used a ton of foul language (and I mean he would make a sailor blush). People with positive reviews must be overlooking these faults.  Hard to make a good grade.","I found this teacher to be incredibly annoying.  Being a bit of a history buff myself, I found that he often got his facts/stories either mixed-up or entirely wrong.  With other reasons, this is why sometimes I couldn't stand going to class. It was like swallowing a cockroach for 75 minutes.  I realize my opinion isn't the popular one, but oh well.","Class was always interesting and he often told humorous history anecdotes.  Tests were only on information given in lectures, text book reading isn't required.  We had to read three books and write short essays on them during the tests.

She's super nice and easy-going though, so overall she was good!","Dr. Lindsay is a genuinely nice person, knowledgable, enthusiastic, and helpful.

However, the final is graded by Barney, and he is a Stickler.  You are given the material for the test prior to the test, so STUDY IT ALL!","Dr. Barney rocks! He knows everything about American history and includes really insteresting details in his lectures. Two of the three tests are graded by TAs, so prepare for the final really well because he grades very harshly. This is the most interesting class I've taken at Carolina!","Engaging speaking who loves what he teaches.  Mid-term and Final only -- but very difficult if you are not prepared, and it is critical that you do well on the exams as there is nothing else to off-set your grade.

The tests are hard, but if you study enough and pay attention in recitations you'll do well. NOT impossible to get an A.","Dr. Barney looks like he stepped right out of the Civil War and his personality fits what he teaches. He can be very interesting at times and very dull at other times. I took his class on the Civil War and he wrote the book which matched his lectures almost word for word. It is an easy class if you are happy with a B it is difficult to get an A.","Class is a challenge, but he is a good professor. Lectures well, I found the subject matter engaging. 1 essay and 2 big tests make up all of your grade, can really be sink or swim. He will give you review guides beforehand, go to the review session held by the TA and study hard. He grades all his finals, TA splits work otherwise.","Barney was a great lecturer, IMO. Much of his grading is done by his TAs so it depends on them. He grades the final and it's hard to determine what he expects because that's all he grades. He gives you test questions in advance and the material is almost all covered in lecture.","Very strict on grading, much of which is done by TA's. Mine was very tough, making taking this class a regret.","This older man is a wealth of information, and has written countless history texts, read the book he assigns (and wrote himself)..BUT his lectures lend themselves to dozing off.

I highly recommend any of his classes.","Very interesting class, you learn a lot, about things you never have thought about.  But, the tests require a lot of preparation, and it's hard to get an A, well, almost impossible.","A Very dedicated teacher, knows his stuff, i.e. all the books, all the subjects concerning Civil War and Reconstruction.","makes history seem more like a story rather than facts we have to learn... good lecturer","Take good notes and you will do fine."],"courses":["HIST565","CIVILWAR212","HIST565","HIST127","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST560","HIST565","HIST128","HIST128","HIST1100","HIST22","HST022","HIST022","HIST022","254","HST22","HIST100"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"HIST","catalog_nbr":899,"section":98,"class_nbr":2880,"title":"INDEP STUDY/GR STU","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"JACKSON,JERMA A","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=53312","fname":"Jerma","lname":"Jackson","quality":"2.5","easiness":"3.5","help":"3.5","clarity":"3.5","topTag":"Get ready to read (4)","grade":"3.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["GET READY TO READ","LECTURE HEAVY","TOUGH GRADER","GET READY TO READ"],"comments":["I got a B in the class. I thought this professor was a really good teacher, but I felt she was teaching the wrong things. For example, we totally skipped WW1 and WW2. I worked hard and read maybe 85% of the readings.","I didn't enjoy this class whatsoever. The lectures are so boring and Professor Jackson expects you to memorize everything shes ever said. The tests are all essays, she grades harshly, and they are never clear. I was left confused after every lecture. Along with this, she is not helpful if you talk to her outside of class either. Would not recommend","Jerma Jackson is the worst professor I have ever had at UNC. She gives you an insane amount of info in lecture, and expects you to remember it all in insane detail. There are also very lengthy readings before every class, which you're practically expected to memorize. The test are 100% essay based. If you care about your GPA, don't take her class.","Her powerpoint are not helpful at all and the textbook is just a bunch of different readings. She basically just talks the entire class and so its really hard to write down all of the important things because if you miss them when she's talking there's nowhere else to find them. Super boring wouldn't take her as a prof.","Really enjoyed lecture. Super engaging, really kind. Great history class.","If you value your time and want to even marginally enjoy your semester do not take anything with her.Her lectures have little substance and she will literally spend the entire time reading powerpoints to you and \"analyzing pictures\" by making obvious statements about them.Also,she has an annoying voice and talks to people like they are children.","Professor Jackson is a great lecturer. Her class is one of my favorites just because it's interesting! Your TA determines your grade, but Jackson creates the prompts for the writing assignments that will be due every other week. Certainly not an 'easy A' class. She often requires you to stay past the scheduled class time so prepare for that.","Don't expect a good grade, but if you're one of those rare people who come to college looking to be challenged and better yourself, take her class! She has real wisdom and, like any teacher worth learning from, she makes you work for it. If you leave her class angry at anyone but yourself you're doing it wrong.","Literally the worst teacher I've ever had. Rude, mean and moody. Often demands class stay past time. Supposed to be an American History class, basically AfAm hist class without the diversity credit. Asks for \"significance\" on tests, but grades by seeking specific answers instead of seeing what you know like most history classes. Horrible experience","Dr. Jackson is great! She pushes you hard, and makes you defend your point of view, but in her class I became a much stronger writer and critical thinker. Classes like this with professors like her are what college is all about!","Horrible professor. FYS's are supposed to be easier than other classes. Instead, she assigned 2 2-page papers a week, acted like this was the only class her students were taking, and took pride in giving out only 1 A for each assignment. She needs to get over herself.","She is an interesting professor, and she really knows her stuff.  What is really frustrating, however, is the way she grades.  I took her first year seminar expecting it to be an easy A, as all FYSs really should be, but instead I'll be lucky to make a B.","Jackson is an amazing professor. She really knows the information and is passionate about it, so she makes the experience interesting. It's almost fun just watching her teach. The weekly response papers can be difficult, but the grading on those depends on your TA. Jackson herself is great, though. I would definitely recommend her.","She's amazing! Her comments on papers really helped me to improve my writing and find greater meaning in the text.","Thought Jackson was great. She has a fresh perspective on am. history and exposes viewpoints that most teachers wouldnt dare illuminate. Yes there are annoying parts like the section on how to write a good paper, but the focus of the class is not on fact regurgitation but critical thinking, analysis, & questioning what you think you know. Awesome.","No Comments","No Comments","sucks not only as a prof,but as a person as well.my 2nd exam i got a 77 on, went to talk to my ta who told me that &quot;i had every fact on there (essay & IDs), which is why i got *half credit&#63;*&quot; they pull the grades out of their youknowwhats. if you want to learn, try someone else--shes mean, stupid, egotistical, angry, and should not be teaching.","No.  Just no.  Do yourself a favor and take this class with someone else.  (The first day of class she explained how Ronald Reagan was similar to Tim McVeigh)","she's pretty much full of bs, and if you don't agree with her, you. are. wrong.  she assigns readings and papers and talks AT you like its the only class youre taking (what&#63;&#63; you havent done the paper due in a week&#63;! you=bad, baaad person) i dont know what we're doin in this class, and i dont know why i show up every day..."],"courses":["HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST128","HIST569","HIST89","HIST089","HIST128","HIST569","HIST22","HIST22","HIST22","HIST22","HIST022","HIST22"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWFUL","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR"]}},{"subject":"HIST","catalog_nbr":899,"section":99,"class_nbr":7527,"title":"INDEP STUDY/GR STU","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"WATERHOUSE,BENJAMIN C","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":5,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1930763","fname":"Benjamin","lname":"Waterhouse","quality":"4.0","easiness":"3.0","help":"3.0","clarity":"3.0","topTag":"Get ready to read (2)","grade":"3.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["AMAZING LECTURES","GIVES GOOD FEEDBACK","AMAZING LECTURES"],"comments":["Professor Waterhouse is a great lecturer who really knows about American political and business history.
