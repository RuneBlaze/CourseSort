When no one in lecture is able to answer his questions, he doesn't go back over the material, just moves on. When a question is asked in lecture he is even able to explain his answer, just attributes the confusion to a poorly worded question instead.","His lectures are really informative and he is really helpful after class. The exams were tough but I felt prepared by listening to his lectures (the curve helped a lot).","Contrary to the other reviews, I thought Professor Willett clearly defined his expectations. The tests were similar to the practice tests, and his lectures, while a little boring, went into the same level of depth that he expected students to go into on the exam. I never went to office hours, but he seemed nice enough in class.","Dr. Willett seems kind, but he is not a crystal clear lecturer and his expectations are not clearly defined. However, his tests are not terrible. They closely resemble the practice tests he gives students beforehand. Lectures are mandatory for success. Textbook is used lightly, but if you truly want to do well, do all the assigned reading.","Avoid if possible. This guy is condescending and does not care about his students. He makes his tests harder than they need to be, and he focuses on details that are too specific for the amount of material covered. He's a researcher, not a teacher.","NO NO NO NO. His lectures are so boring and so disorganized.  He doesnt fill them in all the way so you have to go sit through his boring class to fill in the definitions and formulas he wants you to know for the test and then the notes are so disorganized you have to go back and reorder them just so you can re-teach yourself the material. AVOID."],"courses":["BIOL201","BIOL201","BIOL201","BIO201","BIOL201","BIOL201"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","POOR","POOR"]}}]
