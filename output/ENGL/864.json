If you need help on a paper or want to understand the material better she's there to help you out. You have to read the novels to pass, but it's worth it as she chooses some really interesting reads. Not like any American lit class I've taken before. Beware the final though, it's tricky.","Getting Dr. D to direct my honors thesis was the hands down the best academic decision I ever made. I'm a better writer, researcher, and thinker as a result of working with her. It was a lot of work, but it was so fun!","An amazing academic and literary experience. I did not leave her class with a notebook full of notes that would lie forgotten; I left her class with a head full of ideas and new perspectives. She does not give exams, preferring papers instead. She gives a lot of reading, but it is always really engaging. Dr. D is among the best at UNC.","This was, seriously, the most amazing class I've ever taken in my life. I would pretty much do anything to take another course from Professor DeGuzman. She is one of the most intelligent people I've ever met, and she makes an effort to engage all of her students. Funny, makes course work interesting, great class dicussions. TAKE HER CLASSES.","She was sooooo good.  I loved her class.  She keeps you on the edge of your seat all class long... every class!","She was soooooo interesting.  Every class flew by!  You should totally take this professor if you get a chance.","AMAZING!","easy grader on essays, open to questions from students and easy to talk to, but class was boring"],"courses":["ENGL345","ENGL691H","ENGL685","ENGL666","CMPL133","CMPL133","CMPL133","ENGL058"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
