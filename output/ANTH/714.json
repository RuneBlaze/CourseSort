She takes a genuine interest in the material and in wanting her students to understand her knowledge. Sometimes it was difficult to follow  her train of thought, but if you do the readings, participate in discussions, and put effort into your composition, you'll get an A.","I had Dr. Holland as a grad student back in the late1990s. She is very knowledgeable and a true liberal (like me).  However, she still needs to be bit more introspective and examine his own ideas regarding race and privilege.  I say this because she seemed to have problems with black males.  It hurts me to have to say this because I really do think she understands (to a certain extent) the struggles of people of color, however I have to &quot;call it&quot; like I see it.","Her explainations of concepts can be unclear but she really seems to care about her students.","Such a weird lady but very cool and always interested in her students. She really wants to help everyone and make sure we all understand what's going on."],"courses":["ANTH499","EDU186","ANTH051","ANTH6"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
