I've always been really bad at it, but Dr. Shade actually made me enjoy it and I got an A-.!  She is a great professor and really cares about her students.  She comes early on test days to make sure no one has questions.  My only criticism is that she takes forever to grade written assignments.","Professor Shade is so sweet. She genuinely cares about her students and never wants to embarrass anybody. She is ALWAYS smiling, just a ray of positive energy. There are two exams, the final, two presentations, and two compositions total so all in all not a lot of work. Would definitely recommend."],"courses":["SPAN100","SPAN204"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
