It was a small seminar-style setting, but I found my peers and I were afraid to make a comment or ask a question for fear of feeling stupid. She is constantly disagreeing with and challenging everything you say. This results in a confidence issue in class. I definitely learned a lot though.","Don't take a seminar class with her. She is very rude and condensing. If it's not what she thinks or feels then she talks down to you and embarrasses you. The language barrier makes things difficult. Only take the class if you are truly interested.","Insightful class with a professor who is an expert in her field. Extremely interesting with term paper as final. Lots of support from her with preparing the paper. I would like to take another class from her. Recommend.","Dr. Hagemann truly cares if her students succeed. Her criticism is constructive and she is a fair grader. I really enjoyed her class.","If you are interested in European History or Women's Studies, I suggest you take a class with Professor Hagemann. Yes, there is a fair amount of coursework and reading, but she is extremely knowledgable about the subject matter and the readings were very interesting.  She gives detailed instructions about what she expects from your assignments.","Not clear in what she wants, but then expects graduate level work. Extremely rude and condescending to students. DO NOT TAKE A SMALL SEMINAR WITH HER.","Professor Hagemann is an incredibly intelligent professor. I suggest taking one of her classes if you get the chance. Her style of teaching will help you reinterpret everything you thought you knew about history. Do not take one of her classes though if your not a serious student as they are difficult and writing intensive. Extremely helpful as well. She really means it when she says to go to office hours.","I would not recommend a small class with her. She was very rude to me on many occasions, esp when I emailed her about questions or concerns I had. I felt that she was targeting me specifically. If you answer a questions and its not what shes looking for, she shoots you down completely and embarrasses you. She expects way too much from her students!","Hagemann's lectures weren't always very interesting.  The bulk of what I learned in this class came from the reading.  Attendance was taken everyday.  I didn't think the language barrier was ever too bad; if anything, it's interesting to hear a different perspective on history.","No Comments","Though I have heard good things about Dr. Hagemann in lecture classes, do NOT take a small class or the history seminar required for history majors with her.  She expects way too much from undergraduate students (truly, she expects graduate-level work and time dedication) and is quite condescending and rude to her students.","Karen is a great instructer.  Her lecturers are not real helpful (could be a language barrier thing) but her assigned reading is really insightful and original.  In addition her background as a German professor is priceless in getting an alternative view of feminist history.  She is also really helpful if you need to meet her in office hours."],"courses":["72H","HIST72H","HIST490","HIST72H","HIST072","HIST72H","HIST259","HIST089","HIST259","HIST89","HIST391","WMST59"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
