While he does give pop quizzes, it's pretty easy to guess when they will be. Basically goes over the entire reading in class so if you fall behind it's no big deal. GO TO EXTRA CREDIT! Show up to class + work hard + extra credit  achievable A in this class","Such a great class for my first semester at Carolina! I was skeptical on the first day, he likes to scare his students with the amount of reading required. It's definitely a lot, but manageable. Class discussions are extremely interesting, and he gives a lot of extra credit opportunities. Best literature class I've ever taken, fulfills gen eds.","Awesome guy, awesome class. He does assign a lot more than other 123 instructors, but I would take it again. Some of the books are a struggle to get through, though he provides valuable insight that make the readings much more interesting. Your first grade will be low, but he gives you the tools to improve it. Definitely recommend this professor.","Prof. S does assign a lot of assignments, but his instructions are very clear. He allowed us to discuss  and develop rubrics as a class, which helped. He really makes the students feel like their opinion and input matters. Expect multiple speeches. The texts read were difficult, but interesting. He is an awesome guy and an inspirational teacher.","Mr. Stapleton's class requires your to do more in other ENGL 105 classes. It's hard. However, grades are separated into mostly 5% and he helps you improve and make things better. The stuff we read in class was awesome and they offered me new insights. He's very helpful and responsible as well. A good instructor.","I am not gonna lie, this guy will make you do way more work than the other ENGL 105 classes, but unlike with those classes, you actually learn a lot and become a better writer. He's funny and extremely smart. If you're willing to write and are a decent writer coming into the class, take it. He genuinely cares for his students and gives you candy!","not easy at all","I absolutely adored Stapleton from the first day of class until the end, including the day he gave me my first D. He's tough but his expectations are attainable, with a little work. He's a &quot;closet genius&quot; in my opinion and very entertaining.  Plus he gave us the opprotunity to earn up to 11 points on our final grade. My first D became an A :)"],"courses":["ENGL120","ENGL123","ENGL123","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL124","ENGL123"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD"]}}]
