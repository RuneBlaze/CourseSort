However she is a very rigid grader and there aren't many assignments/exams, so 1 poor grade can kill your overall grade.  Sakai posts are more difficult than they should be, so make sure you meet with her prior to your 1st post. Participation is very important also.","This class has very interesting content. She is an interesting lecturer but not always open to differing opinions. She gives pop quizzes but they are not very difficult. She is however very unorganized when it comes to group projects.","This class is really interesting. Slocum's teaching style is different, and can be very vague. The readings are what made this class, but if you are an expert at sexuality studies, DO NOT take this class. It's a waste of your time. She is very nice however, and the class is fairly easy but disorganized.","Some great readings, great discussions. She lectures with slides that she reads off of and outlines everything she is going to say before she says it (boo).  She did manage to get people in a very large lecture situation to speak up. GO TO LECTURE with an open mind and you will get an A. She will call you out like a child if you are late.","Excellent teacher, very passionate about the subject, takes care to present all of the material in a very neutral way- allows you to think critically but makes sure you understand what you are expected to know. Attendance is optional for the lecture, mandatory for the recitation. Do the readings and you will get an A, even if you don't attend class","No Comments","Excellent professor. Lectures are interesting and easy to follow. Video clips, slides etc help a lot in understanding and analysis of material. If you go to class you should be fine. I rarely did the reading and got an A.","my favorite class i've taken at UNC!","Class isn't very hard but she is entirely too uptight.  I wouldn't call this one of my favorite classes.","The class is really well structured.  She follows the syllabus to the letter.  It's very informative and interesting.  Pay attention to film clips because they will be on the test.","I am enjoying this class this semester.  The content is very interesting.  By her adding film clips (Like 'How Stella Got Her Groove Back') and interesting readings and transparencies, she helps students become critical thinkers about the information.  In the beginning I thought she was pretty uptight about asking questions in class and arriving late for class, but now I understand that it was only for the students in her classes best interest and also a crunch on time.","class was interesting, easy if you do the readings assigned"],"courses":["ANTH130","ANTH277","ANTH440","ANTH440","ANTH440","AFAM41","ANTH30","ANTH030","ANTH30","ANTHROPOLOGY30","ANTHRO30","AFAM41"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"ANTH","catalog_nbr":897,"section":3,"class_nbr":11347,"title":"SEM: SELECTED TOPICS","component":"Lecture","units":1,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"WF","time":"10","instructor":"WEST,COLIN THOR","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":null,"enrl_cap":12,"enrl_tot":12,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1680184","fname":"Colin","lname":"West","quality":"4.2","easiness":"2.3","help":"2.3","clarity":"2.3","topTag":"Hilarious (3)","grade":"2.3","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["LECTURE HEAVY","TOUGH GRADER","INSPIRATIONAL","RESPECTED","INSPIRATIONAL","HILARIOUS"],"comments":["His class was just boring and I don't think I would ever take it again. I had to make myself come to class, and by the end of the semester I wasn't even coming to class except for once a week. Theres no need to go to class though, you can basically just teach yourself everything based on the powerpoint he posts. Wouldn't take a class with him again","Really cool guy and the class itself was interesting.  He tells lots of interesting stories about his personal stories and always tries to make you laugh and keep you engaged in a big lecture.  The only thing that was frustrating was how specific the tests were.  He gives study guides but they are way different from the tests.  random specifics","Really liked this class! Laid-back atmosphere and West tells great stories about his kids and the field work that he's done. The subject matter was interesting and not difficult. Would definitely take a class with him again!","Probably my favorite class b/c of West. He is very passionate about what he does and it's clearly evident. He's done a lot of field work, so class is interesting b/c he'll have \"West story time\" and never fails to make the class laugh. He assigns readings but I never read and have an A. Go to class and look over powerpoints (all the info is there)","Thor West loves his job and that definitely shows in the classroom. As long as you pay attention and go to class tests aren't that hard. He's so passionate about his work and tells so many little relevant stories that it keeps the lectures interesting.  He's such an interesting person and won't fail to make you laugh during class.","Coolest professor. He loves to tell (relevant) stories about his field work and his kids. He expects participation but it's very easy. Awesome class and he knows the topics and readings","West is great! decided to take ANTH 459 b/c I thought it sounded interesting, not thinking it was too high of a level for my year/major. However, it was my highest grade (A)! Not too much work, just a lot of reading. But he sympathizes when the reading is boring, so dont stress about tough ones. Helps a lot to be a naturally strong writer","West is really nice and enthusiastic about the subject matter. Warning: there is a lot of reading to do in the class, but he doesn't give quizzes. Available for help, only 2 papers and a small presentation and a bigger one. Great guy! I recommend him","Dr. West is a terrific professor. I knew nothing about Africa until I took his class.

He gives really clear study guides for exams so they're easy A's. You have to come to class as attendance is part of your grade, but he's a great lecturer and a very good natured guy. If you need help, he'll give it to you. Do your assignments and you shouldn't have any problems.","Took this class expecting an easy and chill experience. Not the case at all. The lectures are long and boring and most of the time don't pertain to the course material at all. His sense of humor is bad and gets in the way of proper communication of the material. Takes forever to receive any graded work back. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS.","Billman has got to be related to Bill Murray. They sound so much alike and have the same wacky, dry sense of humor. Lectures were entertaining, and the tests weren't too difficult if you study the test prep guide. I suggest utilizing a google doc with your classmates.  Love it when he brings his dog, July, to class. She's the sweetest.","The class was extremely dry and boring for me. Many things covered in lecture were never tested on. I relied on Google docs and going over the objectives to study for tests. The tests were moderately difficult, all free response, and sometimes required you to give years for when things happened (which I never managed to memorize).","Professor Billman is a great guy, but based on others rate my professors I went into this class hoping that it would be an easy A.  That is not the case.  The tests are all short answer and an essay, NO MULTIPLE CHOICE. And there is so much information that studying seems impossible.  Billman is hilarious and makes the lectures interesting though.","Makes a potentially dryboring topic very interesting. As long as you go to class, take decent notes and do most readings you will be fine. Very approachable if you have questions, you might be annoyed by his humor but I thought it was endearing. Made me want to take more ANTH classes in the future.","Great professor, manages to make even dull subject matter interesting. Funny and laid back teaching style with entertaining personal stories mixed in.","The best professor I've had at this college. He loves what he does, which makes the class fun and interesting. He's funny and shares stories, which help you remember the material and understand practical application. His black lab is adorable, too.","He's a great professor! He's really laid-back and managed to intertwine stories of his college/youth years into the lectures to keep us engaged and entertained. He makes lots of jokes and was a great way to end my day. I loved that his dog always came to class, too. Only complaints are MC questions and the outside reading book. Textbook &quot;optional&quot;.","Good lecturer, interesting class. He's funny and tries to make even the dry material interesting. The readings are a bit arbitrary, but the textbook is helpful when writing papers. Tests are fairly easy if you know the objectives. Definitely take this class.","Very funny and engaging. I didn't fall asleep in his class once. He brings his dog, July, to class, and she goes everywhere with him. This class helped me decide to major in anthropology.","awesome guy and easy class. his dog comes to every class. tests are pretty easy but mc questions can be random. don't bother getting the textbook. you only ever use it for the essays. just borrow it.","Interesting class, but not easy...do not take this class just to fill a Gen. Ed. requirement.","My favorite teacher at UNC so far. Always made class really interesting and had a great sense of humor. Tests weren't that bad as long as you know the course objectives really well.","Billman is an excellent professor and really knows what he is talking about. His examinations are what cause people to do poorly because his multiple choice questions are unclear and rather arbitrary. The book is useless and I never used it, except fro random quotations in the 2 essays. If you like dogs, take his class, because he brings her!","Very interesting class! Lectures go into great detail, but are engaging. Tests contain somewhat random material from the lectures, but overall a pretty easy class.","The tests are fair if you have studied the objectives. The ONLY time I used the textbook was to extract some facts for the 2 essays. It takes forever to get exams and essays back, and the TAs really don't work very hard. Billman is extremely entertaining and knowledgable. He is passionate about his subject, but does tend to focus on the details.","Anth 145 is the best class I've taken so far at UNC (only had one year though). Tests were harder than I expected, but the papers weren't as bad in my opinion. Has a great sense of humor.","LOVED THIS CLASS. anyone who is interested or needs this credit take anth145. billman is the man. dont take lots of notes, but remember key dates/points. lectures keep you entertained. reading the book isnt super helpful, i only skimmed it.","He likes to talk. He'll tell you more than you need to know - pages of notes that won't be on the test, but you're not going to know that until you see the test so write everything down anyways (sites are important).  He doesn't push his TAs very hard so expect your grades late, say two to three weeks or so.  Otherwise a good class and prof."],"courses":["ANTH220","ANTH220","ANTH220","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH220","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTH145"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
