His class seems hard at first but he is a very easy grader (I got 100 on every paper) because he cares more about you showing you learned something than actual grading. He assigns a lot of reading but you can get through it by skimming. There were no tests or quizzes."],"courses":["HIST174H"],"courseRatings":["GOOD"]}}]
