If you're taking this class, be ready to work for an A. He does curve at the end though","This class was way harder than expected, and Dr. Benninger is a really nice guy once you get to know him but it was difficult to stay focused in class because the lectures are pretty mundane. He does curve tests pretty substantially which is nice!","Lectures are boring but he talks at a pace that's perfect for note-taking. All the exams were multiple choice but extremely difficult. Definitely not \"rocks for jocks.\" Thought it would be an easy A but was sadly mistaken. Wait until you can take GEOL101 with Kevin Stewart, if you have the chance. Seriously.","Not a bad teacher but he's pretty boring. Tough to stay focused during lectures.","Prof. Benninger is a sweet, older man who loves the subject of geology. His lectures are fairly boring, but he makes several humorous remarks that are hysterical if you are paying attention and catch them! To me, his exams were incredibly difficult though, but I am not good at multiple choice tests.

However, if you tend to get bored (as most individuals did), I would recommend renting the textbook.","I have been a student at the UNC for some time now, and I have never had a worse lecturer than Dr. Surge. No doubt that she is remarkably intelligent in her field... However, she is just a terrible lecturer. Literally says \"uhmm\" every other word, and stumbles through her powerpoint.

Drew is an awesome guy-- how many professors take you on a trip to California? If all you care about is the grade, you might not want to take this class. If you care about making friends and having a one-of-a-kind experience however, I'd highly recommend.","If you want to make amazing friends, get to know an awesome professor, and go on a trip to California to practice what you learned in class, then GEOL 72H is for you. Even if you aren't that into geology consider taking this class. Not many people get A's, but I'll happily take my B along with the great memories I have from GEOL 72H!","I had no previous knowledge about geology but I decided to take the course because hey, who could say no to a trip to California? I was pleasantly surprised about learning things that could apply to several things. Beware of the final group project because only one person will actually get an A in your group, but you'll also get life-long friends.","One of the best professors I've had at UNC...you can tell how much he loves the subject and is invested in his students' understanding of the material.","Great professor and a good man. Can be pretty funny","Very interesting and intelligent professor. Makes you work hard but guarantees you learn a lot and really makes the subject fun","Amazing Professor! He makes dull subjects fun and is always hilarious. Get to know him, and express interest, and he will give you tins of help.","This teacher was amazing! I hate geology, but he made it entertaining and fun. Tests were pretty hard, but he gives sample exams, so they're not unbearable. Overall, an amazing class! Take it!","He's a natural teacher, very entertaining, and will never cease with subtle witty humor. He does a great job explaining geology concepts, even to people like me who lack any knowledge of the field. He's one of the most fun professor's I've met!","In-class exercises(ICE's) break down all of the conceptual elements into collaborative learning for everything that is on the test. This class also has one of the best TA's around(Ryan Mills). This is a hard subject (know the Miller Indices, Mineral Formulas, Indicatrix) but the professor works extra hard to make sure you can understand.","Demanding but effective and fun teacher.

I appreciate his feedback and his clear dedication to geology. Writing this review a bit late, but he's just a great prof. Be prepared to work for that A though!","K Stew is the best! His tests are straight from his lectures so you definitely have to go, but he's so interesting that you won't even want to skip. He simplifies everything down so that everyone can understand everything. The only grades are tests, but they're all multiple choice. Best professor at Carolina and I'm not even a science major.","Quite possibly my all-time favorite professor. You can do the reading and kind of get an idea of the concept, but then you go to class and just start listening to K-Stew talk. Five minutes later, you realize you suddenly understand that concept from the book like it's the ABCs. That's how good he is.","K Stew was one of my favorite professors last semester! Super helpful and really clear with what he expects.  Reading isn't really required but you do need to show up to class everyday - his lectures are his tests.","Up until professor Stewart, I haven't had a single instructor that could allow for me to actually bare any sort of science course. Geology isn't just a subject to teach to Stewart, it's a passion and lifestyle that projects through his energy. There were too many times where I was so caught up in his lectures that I had forgotten to take notes!","This guy was seriously my favorite professor I had this semester. I do not like science by any means and wanted to take the easiest one possible. Highly recommend this class if you're a non science major trying to get the PX credit. I got a C in the class but that's a reflection of me as a student, because he really is a great teacher.","Such an amazing professor! His passion for what he's talking about is so evident, and he's one of the smartest people I know. No class with him is going to be easy, but he is extremely helpful and always there for you. His lectures are engaging and he's hilarious. Highly highly recommend taking a course with him, you won't regret it!","Dr. Stewart is, undoubtedly, one of the best professors at UNC. He's wonderfully passionate about Geology and really enjoys teaching. Definitely take the time to talk to him after class! His tests aren't easy, and his class will push you intellectually, but he's 100% there to support you along the way. (It's totally doable.) Take it!","I did not look forward to taking this class at all; I was just trying to get my sciences out of the way. However, he is the best professor I had during my first semester and he made the whole subject extremely interesting. You will be doing yourself a favor if you take this class.","I was one of those kids who REALLY dreaded having to take a science credit at UNC. Kevin Stewart was so good I ended up taking another class in Geology with him! Absolute must take if you need to take a science class.","Please take him. He is the best teacher I have ever had.","Kevin G! He is my favorite teacher so far at Carolina. I took his first-year seminar and now I'm enrolled in his GEOL 221 class for the Spring. He is really passionate about what he is teaching and he truely cares about his students and makes sure they get something out of the class. I'm actually thinking about majoring in geology because of him.","K-Stew is the bomb. Plus awesome fieldtrips.","Dr. Stewart is a great person all-around. Really cares about what he is teaching about, and gets the class excited about geology... all the test question come from lecture, so go to class. great class discussions, definitely gets you thinking about how powerful mother nature is...","Awesome professor! Favorite so far, this class was fun and I enjoyed going. Attendance wasn't mandatory, but it was definitely worth it as the only thing on tests was what he talked about in lecture so there was so need to read the book! Tests were multiple choice and pretty easy as long as I studied! He's also really funny! Take this class!","If you're looking for a science credit definitely take this class! Professor Stewart is extremely clear and makes geology interesting. I never read the book but felt prepared for every test. Everything is very straight-forward.","He was one of the nicest and smartest professors I have ever had at UNC.  Attendance isn't mandatory, but he has a 'chart' one where people sit just to know who's there or not...tests are MC and not that hard if you read over the book and go to lecture. He is crystal clear on everything. I recommend taking this class.","He's my favourite professor in UNC! The way he teaches, just makes you feel like you see the whole geological history unfolding through a mental movie reel. My favourite class! Class attendance is ABSOLUTELY important - as long as you pay attention, an A is in reach. And besides, why would anyone wanna miss a class that interesting&#63;&#63;&#63;","He's an awesome professor!

I couldn't care less about Geology beyond a general interest in science as a layperson, but he made me care, and I learned a lot. He is helpful, clear, brilliant, engaging and fair: if you study his slides, you will pass easily.","I'm not a science major and was pretty uneasy about taking the class at first. But, the material is relatively pretty interesting, gets better over the semester, and you learn a ton. Professor Pavelsky is one of the best I've had at UNC and I would highly recommend the class. He's very enthusiastic and loves helping his students.","Very passionate about his work and it carries over to the class. The class is not unreasonable by any means, and you will surely learn. I would highly recommend it for anyone concerned with Earth's changing climate.","Tamlin's hydroclimatology class was excellent. Inspiring lectures that taught you a lot. Sometimes a little unorganized with his notes but overall straightforward tests and homework. Expects you to be able to read and understand research papers, so this is a fairly upper level class.","I am definitely not a science major and didn't understand a lot of his lectures; however, he is very helpful explaining things one on one.  If it wasn't for his help, I would have never passed the class.","He is always enthusiastic, but he requires a level of work that takes up to 8hrs a week. Don't take this class if you want an easy A, but it is definitely worth what you learn. Can be harsh in grading though.","Lectures are really boring, it's really hard to pay attention in the class but he is really enthusiastic about the subject and if you go to office hours he is very willing to help. His exams are really hard, but his grading isn't too bad.","Really willing to provide extra help, exams are tough and ask for more understanding than memorization. Go to office hours if you find yourself doing poorly; he will tell you what he's looking for in exams. Likes engaging students in the material. Easy to zone out but if you pay attention its super easy to understand everything.","Very enthusiastic about the subject but moves a little slow. A really nice guy though.
