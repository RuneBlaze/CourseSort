There are on average 4 readings you must complete before each lecture in order to keep up. There are no tests, but 2 long papers, which are either graded harshly or nicely depending on your TA. And pop quizzes make you regret that ONE reading you didn't do the night before.","I loved Professor Bayne! His lectures were interesting and he was easy to listen to and approachable.  Your TA is key because they do all of your grading so it is important to show them you care.","Dr. Bayne's class has been one of my favorites so far at UNC. He is a great lecturer and you can tell he loves what he does. Class is very substance heavy but he does a good job of peppering them with videos and jokes.  I would definitely take this class again.","Professor Bayne is one superb professor!  His lectures are well organized, well presented, and fascinating.  His TA's are his  team members and everyone is on message.  Professor Bayne is a star!","Bayne's Class was great! It was extremely enjoyable and made me want to take another religion class at UNC. The TAs do grade harshly, so be careful on your papers. I never did any of the readings, but still managed to pull a decent grade in the class. Only one exam (the final) so just make sure you study for it. He basically gives you the answers.","Professor Bayne is awesome! The lectures are boring and there's a lot of reading, but the class was pretty easy for satisfying 3 Gen Eds. Just come to class and put in the effort and its an easy A. The TAs are really harsh graders so make sure you see them outside of class for your papers and you'll be fine. Would definitely take this again!","Bayne is a very good professor and has a great understanding of the material.  However, although the TA's are nice, they are harsh graders and the directions on most assignments are very bleakunclear.  Also, attending class is a must, and there is a lot of reading for each class.  Only take the class if you are truly interesting in the course.","Awesome professor! He actually cares about learning everyone's names and getting their opinions on the readings.  He's approachable and the material is interesting.  Definitely recommend.","I had Bayne for RELI140, Religion in America. This was by far, the most interesting class I had at Carolina and Bayne made it that way. The grading is very fair and the TA's are all awesome. Bayne puts in so much time into the class, learning people's names in a 150 person class, and shares his passion for this subject with everyone."],"courses":["RELI140","RELI140","RELI140","RELI140","140","RELI140","RELI140","RELI140","RELI140"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
