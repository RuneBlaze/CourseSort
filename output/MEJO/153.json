If you follow his directions, you'll learn a whole lot, but you'll likely take some grade hits in the process. Very difficult to get an A in the class, but doable. A B is most likely if you work hard and listen to him. The class was a blast to be in every day.","Chris is the reason I chose to major in journalism. He's an awesome professor and really cares about his students. His class definitely isn't easy, but he's a fair grader and I've become a much better writer thanks to him. He's really helpful, and if I could take every JOMC class with him I would.","Can cut you off without acknowledging you're in the class","Best professor I've had in the J-School. His knowledge comes from his vast experience in the journalism field. Has great connections. Wouldn't think twice about it!","Can't believe anyone hasn't rated him yet for this class. Business Reporting is the best class I took at UNC, and I had little interest in the topic before. Made it fun and enjoyable.","Chris teaches you what you need to know. He really helped me improve my writing, although it wasn't an easy class. If you have to take this class though, take it with him.","great prof! nice guy! tells you exactly what he wants, no gimmicks. very understanding and helpful.","If you have to live through 53, take it with Roush! He grades harshly, but you know exactly what to expect with each assignment. If you come to every class and do the extra credit, you'll be fine. He's got some good stories and he will keep you interested in the material.","He's a great teacher and very personable.  The class is very hard depending on how well your knowledge of grammer and punctuation are.  AP style is totally different and he knows his stuff so there are no &quot;freebie&quot; mistakes.","Yes, it's hard to get a good grade, but he lets you know what you have to do at the beginning of the semester to get one. Just don't ever screw up.","Really hard to get a good grade. probably one of the strictest prof you could have for 53, but still a nice guy.","The J-school needs more professors like him. Too many of them have gotten old and forgotten what it was like to write for a living. He's a stickler for AP style and grammar though.","Grades totally by the book.
