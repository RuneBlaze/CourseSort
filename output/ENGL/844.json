She's nice and approachable, and loves what she teaches. Made poetry fun and interesting, and is willing to talk to you outside of class and helpful when you do. Values hearing from the students and working with them in class.","Intelligent, nice teacher. But class meetings lacked organization. No clear links between authors and not enough historical context. And you had virtually no idea what your grade was all semester. She's helpful if you go to office hours but doesn't seem to care much unless your questionpaper topic is similar to her research interests.","Dr. Richards is a sweet woman who cares deeply for each of her students. She helps those who need it without making you feel dumb or insignificant. There was work but nothing unreasonable. I would say she is the best professor I've had in my two semesters at UNC. I truly don't understand where any of these negative reviews came from, she is great!!","well sometimes she'd talk about books she hadn't read.  someone would ask a question and she'd say so.  not sure what the point of most the lectures was.  also, a 100 question final.","I've taken lots of English classes and I HATED this one. Some of that has to do with my TA, but Eliza was a horrible lecturer. So boring and so scatterbrained! Stay away. There are much better English profs out there.","I thought she was a great professor.  I loved the material she picked (easy Poe, Hawthorne, Frederick Douglass).  She is obviously very knowledgeable in these areas.  She's a little scatter-brained - changes her mind about some assignments.  But she's always very helpful and easy to access and work with.  I loved this class!","I had the complete opposite experience with her.  She required an unreasonable amount of work, was not clear on her expectations, and was EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful.  I felt unwelcome in the class and got the sense that she is only concerned with students who share her academic interests.  Her class caused me a huge amount of stress!","She was kind and helpful, not demanding really and she clearly enjoyed being there every day.  A good teacher especially for non-english-majors picking up a perspective class."],"courses":["ENGL348","344","ENGL444","ENGL347","ENGL344","ENGL343","ENGL217","ENG83"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME"]}}]
