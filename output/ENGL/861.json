She was interesting...She's really nice but is a stereotypical english teacher who gets lost in poetry, closes her eyes, and smiles for a bit. Kind of awkward. Can be annoying but overall, nice.","She is a really sweet person with a pretty quirky personality. There is a quiz at the beginning of every class so reading is mandatory, but she frequently lets class out early. Definitely recommend--makes romanticism fun and interesting!","Absolutely dreaded her class!!! She was not interesting and my idea of learning is not memorizing what poems go with what authors. There was way to much reading for the class and not enough time spent on the poems.","I found writing essays for her very difficult. She's not very clear as far as what she wants. However, I did go and talk with her on a couple different occassions and after talking with her things always seemed to get better. Just make sure she knows your name from the first day and everything will be fine. You'll find she's very approachable.","I could never imagine this woman being referred to as a &quot;sweetheart.&quot; Her close-minded views and general idiocy has corroded any semblence of decent humanity.  Stay away if you're looking for an honest, fair exposure to Romanticism.","This professor taints the entire academic experience. She blatantly ignores key authors of Romanticism in order to trumpet her own uber-feminist views. As a female student, I took offense to her close-mindedness. She is rude and cold. Stay away if you believe in academic integrity.","Extremely biased and closed-minded. Incredibly nasty and disrespectful IF YOU GET ON HER BAD SIDE (read: express an opinion she does not agree with). About as unprofessional a professor as I have ever encountered.","Great teacher.  Moskal is a sweetheart as well as a good instructer.","She's a good professor, and I like how her class is structured (only 4 grades).  There's a LOT of reading, though, and the book is the heaviest one I've encountered here."],"courses":["ENGL87","ENGL437","ROMANTICPOETRY","ENGLISH72","ENGLISH","ENGL72","ROMANTICS","ROMANCEWRITERS","ENGLISH72"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
