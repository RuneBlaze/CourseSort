I was surprised to find him to be gruff/impatient in office hours. Also, I heard him and the TA's's loudly talk about me once. Decent student/make good grades, so Im not deserving of smack talk. If you want a professional instructor and not a Regina George incarnation, avoid.","Fantastic professor. Get ready to start participating because he always makes sure to include everyone in the discussions. He keeps the topics current and interesting, and is very passionate and enthusiastic. Good deal of reading and homework and it isn't an easy class, but it's worth it. Work hard and your German will see a sure improvement.","Really great professor and person in general. I was frustrated with my vocabulary, and he could tell. I got a spontaneous email one day from him explaining the struggles he had with learning german. He constantly offers to meet with you to practice german. Unlike most german profs he makes lecture comfortable instead of a game of russian roullette.","Fantastic! Engaging, cusses like a sailor, passionate about German philosophy. Must keep up with the readings, writing assignments, and lecture classes. If you show up, turn in assignments, and study 3-4 hours per test, you're golden. More than willing to get coffee with students. One of the most accessible professors I have had. Love him!","Langston is the man!  He's so enthusiastic about teaching and is really down-to-earth and cool.  Even in a huge lecture hall, he makes an effort to involve the class in discussions about 20th c. German philosophy.  Do the readings, keep up with the homework, and you'll do fine.  I'm definitely going to take another class with Langston.","Assigns a good amount of reading, but overall a great professor. Makes class entertaining, and definitely worth the workload.","great prof","I took Dr. Langston's Avant-Garde Cinema first-year seminar class and was absolutely delighted. :) He was very energetic and placed a lot of emphasis on getting to know each student individually. There was a fair bit of reading in this class, but not enough to be overwhelming. Recitations were pretty long to accommodate the films we watched.","Dick is a great professor and knows his stuff. He is a nice guy and will help you out if you need it. And contrary to the previous post the German Department at UNC is great. If you are a major of one of the gigantic departments where you have no contact with faculty being a German major is a great change.","No Comments","one of the best professors i've ever had","the german department sucks."],"courses":["GERM280","GERM302","303","GERM280","GERM280","GERM257","GERM000","GERM060","GERM98","GERM90","GERM","GERM"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWFUL"]}}]
