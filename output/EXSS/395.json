The tests are easy as long as you are able to memorize, no surprising or trick questions.  The lectures can get kind of boring, but not bad.

Consistently, his exam questions had incorrect answers which I pointed out and they were not corrected. Quite frankly, I feel as if I answer a question correctly, I should get the points! Mr. Hanson does not, wish I had more room to elaborate.","Did not enjoy this class. The professor did not keep me engaged at all. Although he made the PowerPoints available, they were not very clear. Therefore, when we had take home tests I sometimes did even worse on them than the in class tests. There were a total of 6 tests, which was nice because each test did not have a large chunk of material.","Extremely unclear lecturer. He does not explain topics well at all, which screws you over for tests.","Reading the textbook is necessary to do well in this class since he makes many topics unclear. He also often takes a while to respond to emails.","Professor Hanson has trouble conveying the concepts to students. This is clear on many exams, where the language and answer choices that Professor Hanson uses confuses many students. Professor Hanson made this class harder and more confusing than it should be."],"courses":["EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276","EXSS276"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","POOR"]}}]
