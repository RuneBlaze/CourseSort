Her classes are engaging and relevant. However, she is spread too thin. She doesn't have time to invest in her students outside of class or to grade assignments in a timely manner. Two-page papers not graded for 30-45 days. Reading sometimes not posted until 10:00pm night before.","I would highly recommend this class- Amy Cooke is a great lecturer and the content is extremely interesting and relevant.","Great professor. Lots of readings, but since water is my life, I loved the material we learned in the class. She's a very interesting professor and reflects passion for what she teaches. Would take another class with her! Exams can be a little ambiguous sometimes. Sometimes 3 reaaaaaaaaalllllyyyyy long readings for one night.","Dr. Cooke is very involved in what she teaches and is a great lecturer. I looked forward to going to her class. She was engaging and all of the homework was reading articles.","I love Amy Cooke! She takes a personal interest in all of her students and makes time to get to know them. She's the reason I chose to pursue environmental science. She knows her stuff, too."],"courses":["ENEC325","ENEC370","ENEC225H","ENST201","ENST201"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
