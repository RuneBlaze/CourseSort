Makes complex material fairly accessible if you do the work. Do the reading before class. It's important. Grades papers harshly but is a very helpful professor","Interesting material. Repeats himself a lot but is pretty cool- easy exams and exercises as long as you read the book- very short chaps in the book!! Overall a good class- easy A if you go to lecture.","grades hard.  Do not take this class if you are looking for an easy A.  Is not very good at explaining complex topics.","such a boring class. i skipped a lot of the lectures because they were so boring. He gives you power point notes and pretty much repeats them. If you do the homework exercises and study the notes, the test shouldn't be that hard.  they aren't easy either.","good professor.  he's willing to help, nice guy, and somewhat interesting.."],"courses":["PHIL340","PHIL145","PHIL32","PHIL35","PHIL32"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
