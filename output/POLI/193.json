The readings were dry and all on the same topic (Latino voting behavior). Lectures and discussions became repetitive. The novels we read were really interesting though. Overall, an easy A, but LOTS of reading (70+ pages a class).","Professor Benjamin is AMAZING! I took her first-year seminar and it grew my interest in politics and pushed me to change my major. She is very down to Earth and has a very understandable teaching style. The class is discussion intensive, but I'm fairly certain everyone received an A.","Professor Benjamin is awesome. She really knows what she's talking about, and loves the subject matter, which really comes off in class. It's a lot of reading, but if you do the reading and pay attention in class you'll do well. She's also very helpful if you go see her during office hours. I loved her class and would take another with her!","I had her for a first year seminar that was very interesting, and I think most of the class got an A. She is very approachable and open to just chatting about the subject during office hours. There was a ton of reading, but the novels were really interesting and it wasn't totally necessary to do the other readings. Great professor!","Her first year seminar was wonderful. The assigned novels are great - they were entertaining so reading at night was more like pleasure reading and less like work - but it was a lot of reading. The assignments were simple and her expectations clear. She is very young and easy to relate to so class and office hours were actually fun to go to.","While she is very enthusiastic, her lectures can be hard to follow at times. The class was more fun when discussions were encouraged. Overall, I thought that she was a lot of fun. She's very youthful and is good at relating to students. Her teaching style could use improvement, but I'll cut her a break since this was her first class at UNC.","Andrea is very smart, enthusiastic and funny. She is very strict about behavior during class and that made some people dislike her. I didn't mind, though. She clearly expects a lot from students. TONS of reading. Speaks very fast and could do a little more to mix things up in class. Grades were reasonable and office hours were very helpful."],"courses":["POLI71","POLI71","POLI419","POLI71","POLI71","POLI195","POLI195"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":193,"section":8,"class_nbr":16319,"title":"INTERNSHIP IN POLI","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"GENT,STEPHEN E","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1484189","fname":"Stephen","lname":"Gent","quality":"0.0","easiness":"N/A","help":"N/A","clarity":"N/A","topTag":"","grade":"N/A","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":[],"courses":[],"courseRatings":[]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":193,"section":6,"class_nbr":9566,"title":"INTERNSHIP IN POLI","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"HOYMAN,MICHELE M","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=853457","fname":"Michele","lname":"Hoyman","quality":"5.0","easiness":"2.0","help":"2.0","clarity":"2.0","topTag":"LOTS OF HOMEWORK (1)","grade":"2.0","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":[],"comments":["awesome","I enjoyed the class but I must warn it's not for lazy students."],"courses":["POLI77","POLI77"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"POLI","catalog_nbr":193,"section":47,"class_nbr":16650,"title":"INTERNSHIP IN POLI","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"SULLIVAN,TERRY O","load":"100","rank":"INST","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":1,"enrl_tot":1,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1035507","fname":"Terry","lname":"Sullivan","quality":"4.1","easiness":"3.1","help":"3.1","clarity":"3.1","topTag":"Respected (2)","grade":"3.1","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"cold","tags":["HILARIOUS","LECTURE HEAVY","RESPECTED"],"comments":["Great class. You write a few short one or two page papers and one long paper throughout the semester that you work on with a group.

I believe my writing quality improved significantly from taking Sullivan's class and following his writing rules. Take it.","Such mixed feelings about this class! He is a cool man- google him. But I was lost the entire time. Passionate people love him. Slackers hate him. and her certainly has an attitude. if you don't like being picked on- don't take it.","Sullivan is a savage. He scares the whole class at the beginning of the semester by telling them that they only have one chance to screw up so they better make it count. Then everyone works hard, reads the books, learns a lot and comes out of the class with skills very important in political science and writing in general.","great guy, great class, extremely knowledgable","The man IS his field of study and has a depth of knowledge he loves so share even when off topic. He is a character but quite personable. His grading is a mystery to me but if you do what he says on the few papers and put in the effort you should score well. I highly recommend him.","No Comments","Great professor, as long as you are not an idiot. Don't take his class if you aren't serious about the coursework. The grade is determined by a few small (2 page) papers on readings but mainly by a long 10 page research paper at the end of the course.

The recitations are actually really really helpful. Oatley makes the class pretty interactive and that helps a lot. I'm not a poli major so I struggled at times but overall it was definitely really interesting.","Wonderful teacher. Personally, I felt I struggled with the first exam, and he was extremely willing to help. Very nice, readings aren't too bad, and he occasionally cracks jokes. Lectures do get boring at times, but it's Intl politics, what do you expect?","Professor Oatley is incredible. He's very well spoken and explains difficult concepts super well. I would definitely take another class with him.","Professor Oatley makes this course enjoyable. He teaches in a thought provoking manner and exposes all sides of a situation and links case studies to themes and reoccurring phenomenon. Beyond that he is a very personable and helpful person. He also has the coolest shoes.","First thing: he's a gorgeous, Anderson Cooper-esque silver fox.  He's also very knowledgeable about IR.  I didn't like the class because I didn't find it all that interesting, but if you're interested in the subject then he's great!  He's very funny and also keeps you engaged in the lectures. Warning: uses game theory ALL THE TIME.","I LOVE Dr. Oatley! The class was a bit dry, but he's the best professor I've had in the Poli department. Brilliant, doesn't give opinions, caring, and level-headed. Really cares about his students. The class's worst aspect is the 3 TA-graded papers. Midterm was a piece of cake. Get to know Oatley... he's a fascinating and kind human being!","One of my favorite professors I've had! He can be a little boring sometimes, but the material keeps me interested. Super-duper nice guy! Very fair and clear expectations when it comes to exams and papers.","Great professor, if you have any questions  be sure to go to his office hours, as he is extremely able and willing to help. He is very knowledgable and the class should be interesting for anyone interested in Economics/International Politics.","Toatley is my hero. The class can get a little boring and difficult at times, but he's so helpful, and all the TAs seemed okay. He's very friendly and will be happy to clear things up if you need help. Seriously, take his class.","Professor Oatley is wonderful and is not one of the stereotypically stuck-up professors you run into sometime. He encourages the most participation in his class of over 250 people of any I have taken at Carolina. Lot of reading that is often scholarly but still a fairly good class. I was not interested in the topic very much but he made it better.","Best class I've taken at Carolina. He was an engaging teacher and really knows his stuff. I wish he taught more undergrad courses because I would definitely take a class from him again. There is a lot of reading but it's usually very interesting. Go to office hours at least once or twice.","He just follows his powerpoints- what elaboration he does add is really wordy and typically doesn't make sense.","I loved this class and the professor even more. His lectures, though sometimes boring, are well planned so you can easily follow the subject matter. Your grade is based on 3 kinda tricky multiple choice tests, but if you read the posted articles (that are actually interesting most of the time) and discuss in recitation, a B+/A- is easy to obtain.","Really enjoyed this class because I really enjoyed the subject matter. He posts all the notes from class online. I thought most of the readings were interesting. You have to understand the readings to do well on the tests. I would definitely recommend his class.","Professor Oatley is super nice, but his class is totally unenjoyable. The lectures are terribly boring and there is A LOT of reading. Unless you have time to read 50-100 pages of scholarly material each week, don't take this class.","Whatever you do, don't take Poli 58.  The course was a disaster and I don't think any of us learned anything (except research methods- those were useful).  Dr. Oatley is very nice, intelligent, and helpful, but his subject will bore you to tears.  There were several times when I contemplated throwing the Sanders book into a fireplace.","Great teacher! He loves what he does and is willing to do anything for a student who reaches out for help. Not great subject matter in this class, but I would love to take a different class with him","A truly magnificent professor. I would recommend this class to anyone who is remotely interested in international relations. Also, he literally wrote the book on political economy. Go to lecture and recitation and it's an easy B+, but an A is also attainable.","Oatley is a great professor - he's very fair, accommodating, and is an expert on the subject matter.  I found his class intriguing, and I really wanted to learn the material.  Go to his office hours, although he is a little awkward, talking to him one-on-one can help clear up any questions you may have. I recommend this class.","Oatley is a really nice guy, and the class was interesting.  He's not a great lecturer do to the fact that he's kind of awkward and sounds permanently congested, but he definitely knows his stuff.

Though test prep may take some time, there are no curve balls on his tests.  Attendance and participation aren't required, but by going and paying attention you'll have all that you need for the lecture part of the tests.  Very nice and funny guy!","Professor McGuire has become one of my favorite professors at UNC. If you're interested in anything related to the Supreme Court or the Constitution, he's the best pick. I've also taken his Supreme Court class and it was excellent! Professor McGuire is a fantastic lecturer and always encourages student dialogue.","Professor McGuire has been one of my favorite professors at UNC. The course was 4 non cumulative tests and a 10 page paper. He is clear about expectations and he is an engaging lecturer. If you are pre-law I would highly suggest taking him as this class is mostly constitutional case study.","McGuire is my favorite POLI teacher because he speaks clearly and concisely. He also has an awkwardly funny sense of humor, which makes the class less boring. Three exams and a non-cumulative final. Three in-class essays in response to an article that was given ahead of time. It is clear what he expects of you, which makes it easier to get an A.","A nice guy, who knows a lot about the subject.  But, McGuire is quite possibly the worst test-writer I have ever encountered in my life.  He teaches on very objective material, which is redundantly echoed by the book and then makes his multiple choice tests a tricky subjective guessing game.  I don't recommend this class.","all in all this class was ok. his lectures, although helpful, were pretty repetitive and boring. the class isnt hard per-se but definitely not the best class ever.","Dr. McGuire rocks! He always keeps class interesting. Assignments always have a true purpose. He's extremely friendly and helpful if you ever need to see him outside of class. If you want an A, you HAVE to do the reading.  Multiple choice questions on exams can be tricky so read them very carefully. Overall, great professor and class.","Class was very interesting and Prof McGuire is a great lecturer. His tests are challenging but doable if you've read thoroughly and paid attention in class. Approachable prof who is very willing to help students outside of class.","I took him fall semester in Supreme Court and in Constitutional Freedoms.  The classes were for the most part interesting.  He knows his stuff, and is a good teacher.  His multiple choice tests were pretty easy, especially if you take notes and read.  For constitutional freedoms he was informative.  Test were easy but a lot of information.","Took Him for Supreme Court and US Constitution. Great professor. This is not an &quot;easy a&quot; class- but if you're at all interested in law school its a must. I'm in Con Law right now and am more than prepared due to his class. He's a cool guy who knows his stuff. His multiple choice exam was harder than essay in upper level. You do need to go to class.","McGuire is a great professor and his lectures are very helpful for really grasping the material. I have taken 2 of his classes and would take more if I weren't graduating.","Attendance isn't mandatory because power points are online, but class is so interesting- I went anyway.  The 3 mult choice tests aren't bad if you pay attention/study a lot/and DO THE READING.  Also, don't over analyze the tests questions. Very helpful in office hrs as well...a plus if you make an effort to meet him personally.","Great teacher. i took the class in the summer and the test was 10 short id's. they were straight forward my class avg atleast a B- if not a B. I would highly recommend it.","I really enjoy his lectures.  His 'Civil Liberties' class is even better if you want to actually find out about the Supreme Court cases themselves (this is just the history and functioning of the court) and are looking for a more discussion-based experience.  You MUST go to class and take detailed notes, but otherwise the class is easy.","No Comments","It was easy if you went to class and were able to think analytically about what he says. His tests are hard for some because they often require you to go beyond memorizing and actually learn the material. Almost no reading though and having no papers is a plus.","Lecture was interesting but tests were impossible...DON'T believe him when he says &quot;I don't put trick questions on my exams&quot; on the first day of class!","Easy class if you go to class and do the reading, 3 multiple choice exams.
