Sadly she takes attendance and it really counts. She's great in office hours if you want to discuss paper topics and really loves teaching and Shakespeare. You'll read only 8 plays (which I thought was too few) and have two 8-10 pg papers plus quizzes and she's not a tough paper grader. Recommended!","I have always loved Shakespeare but this teacher ruined it for me. I took English 225. Her lectures are fine and class time was bearable but her only grades are reading quizzes and 2 8-10 page papers. She grades the papers with extreme difficulty and does not give very helpful comments.","Loved this professor and will try to take many more classes with her! Very clear and very fair, and is a bit eccentric but loved her anyways!","Megan wears smocks and seems like a feminist; didn't seem like my kind of teacher. Her lectures were great, she truly surprised me. Go to class, stay engaged, read your stuff. If you ever have questions, go and talk to her. She's super insightful and taught me to read deeper (in all aspects).","Megan was an awesome teacher.  She is very smart and very helpful.","If you like films, then maybe you'll like this class. Many of the films were pointless. Lectures were scattered & even though she uses powerpoint, she gets off track often. My TA saved this class for me.","Excellent, thoughtful professor who made me look at things in different ways. Made me enjoy Shakespeare more than I thought possible.","I wouldn't say she's one of the best professors I've had, but she's not horrible. Her lectures for Engl 225 often get boring because it seems like she over-analyzes every little detail, which seems unnecessary to a non-English major. The plays are amazing though and they are the main reason I loved this close. Her TAs are more interesting, but she","Fun and engaging","Ms. Matchinske is really an excellent teacher & makes the most potentially dreary topics come to life.  I never understood why she thought that Lady MacBeth should be a role model to all women, but it was her opinion, which she is certainly entitled to.  Nonetheless, I was cautious when she held the sharp letter opener. H.John LaVine","I've taken Megan for both Shakespeare and Milton.  Let me just say she's one of my favorite all-time profs.  She's really good at shepherding discussion in interesting directions and opening up elements of the text you would never have noticed.  She's also incredibly friendly, funny, and just an all-around nice person.  This is not to say her class","No Comments","I am not an English major, so I found the 2 10 page papers very difficult. It is also hard to tell what is important during lecture, since there is a TON of reading. She is not easy to get an appointment with BUT if you can go see her about your paper she can help you a ton. 2 papers count 45%, a final worth 40% and participation and attendance 15%"],"courses":["ENGL225","ENGLISH225","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENGL001","ENGL225","ENG225","ENGL225","ENGL225","ENG201","ENGL230","ENG225","ENGL60"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
