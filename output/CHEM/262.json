Her lectures can be rushed but just use the book as a reference and you'll be fine. She really cares about her students and I found her to be kind and helpful. The tests are straightforward if you know what you're doing.","She tries to be accessible but is very confusing in lecture. Oftentimes her solutions to example problems are incorrect and students have to correct her thinking behind a problem. Very test heavy and doesn't allow you to keep tests to study. She is condescending and gets very defensive when you question her methods, and her grading is unfair.","She tries hard, but she needs to reorganize.  She has occasional flashes of clarity, but more often than not her teaching is unclear to the point of absurdity.  You have to put a lot of effort just into deciphering her lectures to do well.  She can also be oversensitive to perceived criticism.  Still likely better than some other orgo professors.","Arguably the worst professor I have encountered in my life. I got an A- in the class but only because I taught the material to myself. Students would often have to correct her on practice problems and concepts because she was not able to properly explain it. Moy is condescending and incompetent.","I had orgo 1 with Crimmins and orgo 2 with Moy. She is not Michael Crimmins. She is still FANTASTIC, though. I came in to her class expecting a terrible professor from the reviews, but she was actually one of my favorites. She gives lots of resources for tests and genuinely cares about her students. I would take her again. I learned a great deal.","Probably one of the nicest chem professors around. Always willing to  help. The exams can be tricky, but if you go to to the optional recitations or office hours, you'll be fine.","She isn't bad at all. Well atleast not anymore. People have said she used to be really bad, but honestly she makes class very enjoyable now. Goto to class, goto recitation, use piazza, and ask her questions directly. Orgo is hard, but Dr. Moy makes it a lot more enjoyable!","Moy is honestly such a great person--she knows what she's doing but it's still a hard class. Not as bad of a teacher as everyone says she is. Was always able to get help and her test averages were generally pretty high . Obviously there's homework, but she gives lots of resources for practice.","The material is tough but she goes out of her way to make sure there is an abundance of resources available: studio worksheets, videos, active on piazza, she even held Q&A sessions immediately  after lecturing for two and a half hours. I, and the other people I know were successful in her class, took advantage of all of it. BEWARE OF HER FINAL.","Moy really isn't that bad other than that fact that she is a little condescending. She isn't the greatest teacher but you can do well if you're familiar with organic chemistry. I read the book before every lecture and did fine on her exams, which are surprisingly not that bad. The only thing that sucks is her final!","Her tests are probably easier than other orgo 2 professors here, but you will probably only do well if you teach yourself everything out of the book on your own. Terribly unclear in lecture, her sentence structure/diction is confusing. Sometimes she taught the straight wrong thing and wouldn't admit to it when people corrected her WITH THE BOOK","The bane of my existence. She is unclear during lecture and has some ridiculous expectations. We had to print and do guided reading questions and then upload them (about 30ish pages each exam). Her final was 44.5% of our grade - you could be fine before and still fail. She's friendly during office hours and exams are mostly fair. Mentors helped!!","Dr. Moy has the world's best intentions, but falls flat when it comes to clearly conveying concepts. She knows what she's talking about, and does say it, but almost nobody can follow what it means. I had to drop the class and hope to take it next semester with another professor, all the time and confusion just wasn't worth it.","I would avoid taking her.  She expects a lot of BS of what she doesn't teach and gives a ton of homework last minute.  Test are also quite hard and are graded unfairly.","I studied all the time and went to a lot of the help sessions. I thought I understood all the material until I took the exams. She was very unclear when teaching. I spent a ton of time on this class and should not have received the grade I did.","Moy improved soooo much as the semester went on. She's really concerned about everyone enjoying the class and learning. Initially, she'd have slides where she'd get ahead of the class, and she didn't have a feel for what exactly was tripping students up (had some trouble answering questions).  Now she's super understanding and great w interaction.","Dr. Moy got a lot better as the semester went on. After nearly 34 of the class failed the first test, she changed her teaching style and the class became better structured. Her tests were all very fair, though there is a lot of self-study involved. Unlike Orgo I, its mostly reactions so its double. After a few more semesters, she'll be great.","She was super sweet, and in a few years I think she will be a good professor. This year though, she was quite disorganized and somewhat unclear as to what she expected. Overall though her tests were very fair (except for a few questions here and there). She is definitely available for help and I strongly recommend going to the problem sessions!","Orgo is hard.  She was hard but pretty fair.  I got out with a C and hated the material, but at least she was enthusiastic.  Anyone who thinks she's the worst in the chemistry department needs to take a few more classes.  At least she smiles.","Moy is the most unclear professor I've had at UNC. She does not know how to handle questions and takes absolutely no blame when half of the class fails, going to great extents to keep the class completely uncurved. Her office \"half-hours\" are allegedly not for chemistry-related questions.

He really knows his stuff and presents it in a clear and comical way. The key exams are the first and final. They are the easiest.

They're not impossible, they're just very challenging. He's a very smart guy and funny too, I'd marry him :) if he weren't already married...boo :(","Hogan is a great professor. Very interesting and very humorous. All though his tests are pretty self-explanatory make sure you work some problems out of the book in preparation for his tests. He doesn't go into too much detail but kinda just touch basis with it","Great Professor!!!!!  He is a great speaker and explains things really well.  He doesn't curve (at least in my class) but drops the lowest test grade.  I would suggest Hogan over any other chem 102 professors.  Do the practice problems to do well on the tests.","I am a Duke student who took this class at UNC (because it isn't offered at Duke in the spring). I have to say, I'm very jealous of the tarheels.

Lots of self-study and reading primary research articles, though.","Brian Hogan is the best professor in all of the chem department. Take his class.","Great Professor! He really knows his stuff and presents it in a clear and comical way. The key exams are the first and final. They are the easiest. I'm thinking he pulled the second exam from a neurological biochemisty textbook. The third exam was fair but not as easy as the first and final. Overall, I really enjoyed him.","Love this guy. I don't like chem, only took it b/c of bio major, but Hogan makes it bearable. He's SO funny, down-to-earth, & understanding. Had class at 8am, not a morning person at all, & STILL found him engaging! His tests are fair, just do what you're supposed to and you'll be fine.

Kept lectures interesting for an 8 AM. Read the book and do the practice exams!","Great Professor, very funny! Learned a lot from the class. Requires intense studying, exasm are fair, but super tricky. Over all, great class, will take another chem class with him any day.","Wonderful!! Read the book and work the problems, but if you do that, tests are a piece of cake. Got a 100 on the first one!","Awesome!! Great teacher. Tests not that hard, but you must work problems in the book. Don't let basic notes fool you. You need to read the book and work the problems to do well on the tests, but no trick problems on the test. Love him!!","The exams aren't *that* hard.  His pedagogy is fantastic, and making the most of your time in class will save you hours of study time.  If you're a strong student, don't listen to him when he says to take 'fru-fru' courses with this--I took this concurrent with Physics 116 over the summer, and did well in both, so it's not impossible.","LOVE him, LOATHE his exams. They're not impossible, they're just very challenging. He's a very smart guy and funny too, I'd marry him :) if he weren't already married...boo :(","Hogan is a great professor. Very interesting and very humorous. All though his tests are pretty self-explanatory make sure you work some problems out of the book in preparation for his tests. He doesn't go into too much detail but kinda just touch basis with it","Great Professor!!!!!  He is a great speaker and explains things really well.  He doesn't curve (at least in my class) but drops the lowest test grade.  I would suggest Hogan over any other chem 102 professors.

He makes biochem relatable.","Astounding professor for a space alien. You'd never guess he's actually a shapeshifting extragalactic killing machine. Lectures are very comprehensive, but I never figured out what enslaving whole solar systems had to do with biochemistry. Maybe that's why I got a Z in his class, whatever that means. He melts if you put hot sauce on him.","Only prof to say anything heart felt about the Eve Carson situation.  Read a beautiful poem to the class.  You may not like the class, but you have to like his humanity.","Nice guy. It is hard to have Chem only twice a week w/ longer class periods at 8AM. I always dozed off. No way were Hogan's kids worked as hard as those in Chamberlin's 101 class, that's for sure! An A in this class no way compares to her As. You're going to be in for a shock going from Hogan's mc tests to written tests in most other Chem classes.","I am not a Chemistry major, and didn't need the class to fulfill any requirements. I took it because I had a mild interest in Chemistry. I am really glad Dr. Hogan was my prof. He was a very fair prof, who somehow managed to show he cared, even in a class with 400+ students. Very clear, funny, intelligent. His tests are moderate, but not tricky.","Dr. Hogan is insane.  How can a man be so enthusiastic about chemistry at 8am!

No tests, no cutthroat pressure, and no boring lectures. Classes are very interactive (although at times unfocused), but Hogan really increases your affinity towards a subject as intimidating as biochem. Lots of self-study and reading primary research articles, though.","Brian Hogan is the best professor in all of the chem department. Take his class.","Great Professor! He really knows his stuff and presents it in a clear and comical way. The key exams are the first and final. They are the easiest. I'm thinking he pulled the second exam from a neurological biochemisty textbook. The third exam was fair but not as easy as the first and final. Overall, I really enjoyed him.","Love this guy. I don't like chem, only took it b/c of bio major, but Hogan makes it bearable. He's SO funny, down-to-earth, & understanding. Had class at 8am, not a morning person at all, & STILL found him engaging! His tests are fair, just do what you're supposed to and you'll be fine. Read the book & do the practice problems, simple as that.","Where is your Tanner Award&#63; Remember, &quot;on average we're all average in our own special way&quot;","Seems really cool but is actually pretty cocky. Kept lectures interesting for an 8 AM. Read the book and do the practice exams!","Great Professor, very funny! Learned a lot from the class. Requires intense studying, exasm are fair, but super tricky. Over all, great class, will take another chem class with him any day.","Wonderful!! Read the book and work the problems, but if you do that, tests are a piece of cake. Got a 100 on the first one!","Awesome!! Great teacher. Tests not that hard, but you must work problems in the book. Don't let basic notes fool you. You need to read the book and work the problems to do well on the tests, but no trick problems on the test. Love him!!","The exams aren't *that* hard.  His pedagogy is fantastic, and making the most of your time in class will save you hours of study time.  If you're a strong student, don't listen to him when he says to take 'fru-fru' courses with this--I took this concurrent with Physics 116 over the summer, and did well in both, so it's not impossible.","LOVE him, LOATHE his exams. They're not impossible, they're just very challenging. He's a very smart guy and funny too, I'd marry him :) if he weren't already married...boo :(","Hogan is a great professor. Very interesting and very humorous. All though his tests are pretty self-explanatory make sure you work some problems out of the book in preparation for his tests. He doesn't go into too much detail but kinda just touch basis with it","Great Professor!!!!!  He is a great speaker and explains things really well.  He doesn't curve (at least in my class) but drops the lowest test grade.  I would suggest Hogan over any other chem 102 professors.  Do the practice problems to do well on the tests.","I am a Duke student who took this class at UNC (because it isn't offered at Duke in the spring). I have to say, I'm very jealous of the tarheels. If all profs at UNC are as awesome as this one, then I think I might have gone to the wrong school. Hogan's tough but totally fair and you LEARN SO MUCH from him. He makes biochem relatable.","Astounding professor for a space alien. You'd never guess he's actually a shapeshifting extragalactic killing machine. Lectures are very comprehensive, but I never figured out what enslaving whole solar systems had to do with biochemistry. Maybe that's why I got a Z in his class, whatever that means. He melts if you put hot sauce on him.","Only prof to say anything heart felt about the Eve Carson situation.  Read a beautiful poem to the class.  You may not like the class, but you have to like his humanity.","Nice guy. It is hard to have Chem only twice a week w/ longer class periods at 8AM. I always dozed off. No way were Hogan's kids worked as hard as those in Chamberlin's 101 class, that's for sure! An A in this class no way compares to her As. You're going to be in for a shock going from Hogan's mc tests to written tests in most other Chem classes.","I am not a Chemistry major, and didn't need the class to fulfill any requirements. I took it because I had a mild interest in Chemistry. I am really glad Dr. Hogan was my prof. He was a very fair prof, who somehow managed to show he cared, even in a class with 400+ students.
