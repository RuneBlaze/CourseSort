It's totally not even worth going to class.  Just read the summaries in the chapters and learn the old tests (from previous years).  The final is questions from the old tests and previous midterms plus some new stuff.  It's easy to do well if you try.","Got a D on the first midterm, wasn't really into showing up for class, came out with a 97 in the class!  It's a cinch if you just read the summaries in the back of the book and practice the old midterms (2/3 of the questions are old).  Definitely the easiest teacher for Econ 10.  Take him!","hard class, failed both midterms. but if you do well on the final you get to have that grade for course grade. most people end up with an ok grade","I seriously went to a total of 6 classes and made a B in his class. His final exam is easy and contains a lot from the first 2 exams. I recommend him!","Boring class, easy final","Great class! Dan Davis was a very fair teacher and definately knows his stuff. Lecture was boring, yet it was helpful to go. I definately recommend this class.","He is a great professor, the lectures are really boring but the material is very clear and easy to understand...and it is helpful to go to class.","He is a great professor.  Explains everything well and the final exam can be your final grade if that gives you the best grade.  P.S. the final exam was rather easy, even for those who didn't regularly attend class.","definitely choose him-- he is the best for econ10- easy exams","Tests were not bad, teacher makes jokes, and attendence is only semi-required. good grading scale too, no (-)'s"],"courses":["ECON","ECON10","ECON10","ECON10","ECON10","ECON010","ECON10","ECONOMICS","ECON10","ECON10","ECON10"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME"]}}]
