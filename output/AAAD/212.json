The Midterm is a 10 page paper on a book he wrote so good luck with that.  When asked for clarification on assignments he will tell you to look at the syllabus which gives no information other than the assignment title.","Not a great professor, lectures are incredibly boring. For the midterm, we had to write a 10 page \"review\" of his book, yet he would not tell us what he expected in the paper, he would just point everyone to the syllabus, which gave little information. Take anyone other than him for AAAD!","I would ask him to clarify on what he wanted for an assignment and he would direct me to the syllabus- which gave the most vague and unspecific instructions. Then you were criticized for not including things that were not specified to be included. The lectures are long and attendance is weighted heavily.","Worst professor I've had at UNC by far. He reads straight from powerpoints the entire class and expects you to memorize them just from that. Extremely unhelpful and rude when you ask questions (he will literally laugh and say \"how do you not know this??\"). Literally take any other professor if possible","This was the worst class I've taken at UNC. Nzongola-Ntalaja's lectures are long and he is extremely monotone. His expectations are not clear in his papers and the course material covers so much you will easily get lost if you haven't taken an introductory level AAAD class. Do not take one of his classes.","This is by far the most boring class I have ever taken at UNC.  He is extremely rude and very unhelpful.  If you ask a question his response is always \"look at the syllabus\".  I learned absolutely nothing in this class.  Steer clear of him!!","I've never had to give this type of feedback, but this was the worst class that I have taken at UNC Chapel Hill. I came to the class really excited to learn about the political structures in Africa and I left the class absorbing about 1% of the course material. Directions are very unclear, syllabus and assignments provided arbitrary information.","Professor Nzongola is extraordinarily knowledgeable of the relationships existing between Africa and the UN.  Work really hard on the PowerPoints and research essay and you should be in good shape overall!","Very impersonal. Very unclear with directions. Mean. Would not recommend.","He is very knowledgeable in African studies.","Prof Nzongola is hands down one of the most knowledgeable academics about the Congo and Democracy in Africa. His classes are very interesting, especially when he goes off into some of his incredible stories. Sometimes expectations can be a little unclear and he can be a little confusing. You need to work for an A, but got a B or better","I disagree-Nzongola is very helpful. Very smart man, knows A LOT and has great personal stories about Congo and even meeting gov officials here in the US. Can be a little unclear on tests but you still get a good grade if the info is right (like the other person said). I loved his class.","Worst professor I have had in my four years at Carolina. I am very interested in the matter and I am willing to work hard, but regardless of the work I did there were unclear expectations and ambiguous grading rubrics. I went to every class and still ended up teaching myself everything necessary for the test. As for his help- it was non-existent.","Nzongola is awesome. Class attendance and reading not totally mandatory but def help. His exams are a little weird, he is asking for something that wasn't really worded right in the question, but he gave everyone full credit for getting all the info right even if the answer wasn't totally what he wanted."],"courses":["AAAD101","AAAD101","AAAD101","AAAD101","AAAD212","AAAD101","AAAD400","AAAD89","AAAD89002","AFRI550","AFRI523","AFRI523","AFRI523","AFRI523"],"courseRatings":["POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME"]}}]
