Keep up, listen for intellectual humor, and work as hard as you ever thought you would.  If you want to know ecology or plants, take his class.  If you want an easy A, drop it.","DO NOT take this course. I had hoped to dig deeper into ecological issues, but all I have experienced is frustration and high expectations.  Peet's lectures are unorganized and do not convey information well. You would think after decades of teaching that he would be a proficient lecturer.  There are more things to life than your class, Bob!"],"courses":["BIOL201","BIO300","BIOL112"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR"]}}]
