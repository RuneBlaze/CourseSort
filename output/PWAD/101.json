Best professor I've had yet. His lectures were very informational and hilarious. Great man.","Great lecturer fun class.","An awesome professor. Public policy - particularly the readings - can get a little cumbersome and boring sometimes, but he does an excellent job of making it as interesting as possible while having to graze over an insane amount of topics in a short period of time. A large class, so it's hard to get to know him, but he's super helpful when you ask.","Dr. G is a knowledgable professor teaching a very vague class. Plcy 101 has a lot of material, but he touches it all and keeps you interested by being interactive and using multimedia. You must read the assigned policy briefs to pass the final. Would I call Dr. G one of the best profs at UNC? Probably not, but he's a really good guy nonetheless.","One of the best professors I've had. Makes every class interesting and really cares about his students. It is well worth your time to come to class because he clarifies difficult points in the readings and makes the ideas from the textbook (READ IT TO SUCCEED IN CLASS!) more applicable. Wish I could take the class again or another course by him.","Dr. Gitterman is absolutely great! His lectures are very clear and quite interesting considering the material can sometimes get a little boring. He does a great job of making you appreciate public policy. There are few assignments throughout the semester, and you absolutely have to attend class. It's not hard, his lectures will make you want to go!","Don't listen to the salty kids-- one of the best professors at UNC. He does hold you accountable, but makes class worth coming to with lectures and videos that keep you engaged and interested in the material. He wants to be fair and he wants you to learn, which is refreshing in a professor.","An amazing professor! He really cared about the students and stressed learning and becoming interested in the material rather than making his class difficult to pass. My TA (McHale) was great; just as engaging as he was and really helpful with any questions I had. The work was easy and little. Great start to UNC! (PS: do NOT buy ANYTHING for PLCY)","Great professor and really tries to connect with the students by showing videos and telling short anecdotal stories to keep you interested.  Make sure to go to class, because although the topics may not be super exciting are very informational and on his tests.  A must have teacher a one point in your Carolina career. If motivated easy A.","Awesome prof!  You have to go to class, but his lectures are really interesting and entertaining and make you want to go.  He really cares about the students and will help you with anything you want.  He's more interested in making sure you learn than making the class difficult.  Everything is graded very fairly.  Best prof I've had at UNC!","I loved this professor. I would recommend my friends and other take his class. It's not easy, but it's not supposed to be. I loved learning about everything in policy and enjoyed his enthusiasm and love for the subject. his lectures are interesting and keep you entertained.","ATTEND CLASS. It may seem like you don't have to, but his TA's monitor the PollEverywhere and they will catch you skipping. Readings are not necessary, and he gives helpful study guides for the exams. One big paper, but outside of that its not a lot of work. He's super entertaining in class, and he shows a lot of videos, which make you want to go","Awesome professor. He kept the class entertaining and gave realistic examples of Public Policy in action. You do need to attend class to do the Poll Everywhere questions and his lectures are the most helpful when it comes to studying for the exams.","This was by far one of my favorites classes. He makes class so interesting and you actually WANT to come to class. Has a little bit of a fowl mouth so if you are sensitive to that beware. Overall, his TA's grade very fairly and are always able to help!","Not as easy as everyone says.  Not particularly work intensive, but not an easy A. The work you do have to do is usually hard to ace.  Midterm and final I got a solid B, pretty much everything was a solid B for me. Gitterman is cool and funny. Not very interesting class, didn't learn much. Readings aren't necessary even for the final.","Excellent professor. Really cares about his students, engaging, and informative. Even if you aren't interested in policy, I recommend a class with Dr. Gitterman.","Took PLCY101 for maymester and loved it. Best professor I've had so far. His lectures were interesting and made the 3 hours fly by. The work was very manageable. He cares a lot about his students and what he teaches and it shows. Highly recommended.","Best professor I've had yet. Personable and hilarious. Extremely fair tests and assignments - no curve balls. He really wants you to succeed, and he will help you with ANYTHING if you just ask. My recitation was a little unnecessary, but it was probably just my TA. Everyone should take this class - it gave me the final push to become a PLCY major.","Gitterman is an excellent professor. He is friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and accessible. He definitely has the best handle on how to engage a 250+ person lecture of any professor I've ever had. Also, he is VERY clear about what he wants in assignments and is fair in grading. There are no curve balls.","Agree with almost all of the previous sentiments on Dr. G."],"courses":["PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101","PLCY101"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
