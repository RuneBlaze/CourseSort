He is dismissive to students, eccentric and erratic in his presentation of lectures, and hard to get in touch with. Anyone with ANY knowledge on the subject will find this painful at best but students with little background might learn something from guest speakers in the lab.","Lecture is around lunchtime so some of the undergrads are a bit sleepy. He restricts enrollment to 10 so you can't hide but combines humoranecdotes with science for a whirlwind intro to \"make a difference\" envr scis careers. Teaches skill sets that are overlooked in other courses. He stays for the entire lab so many opportunities to ask questions","Amazing labs- somehow he teaches all you need to know in 1 lecture & then straight to the lab where we learned how to perform environmental research. Some of the equipment is old but he gets it to work with his awesome TA! This is the only lab class left in the department. Great field trips. This course helped me decide my career. Thanks Dr W!","What a great idea for a class. Dr Weinberg has corralled a diverse group of faculty and some doctoral students to teach with him - the goal is to give students hands on research experience with stand-alone lectures covering a wide range of env scis. He makes his material available online a week ahead so you should listen and interact. Great teacher","This class is not taught in the spring semester so what was the previous writer actually reviewing? Sounds like what she got was deserved!  Here is the reality from 5 of us who just took this class with Dr Weinberg. He inspired us to work together, think creatively, become researchers, & gave us lifecareer skills like no-one else in our 4 yrs","Absolutely the worst teaching experience I have ever had. Unresponsive, unreliable, unorganized, and sometimes outright dismissive and mean to students. Avoid his classes if at all possible.","My experience along with those of most of my classmates was the exact opposite of the previous post. ENVR 411 was among the top 3 most formative classes at UNC. Dr Weinberg did challenge his students to think independently,was always available at the times stated on the class website or by appointment, and his requirements were clearly stated.","My overall experience with Dr. Howard Weinberg at UNC-Chapel Hill was horrible. He is one of those professors that never gets satisfied with your reports no matter how thorough they are. He is extremely picky and tends to always find ways to make life very difficult.He never responds to emails and is never at his office for assistance."],"courses":["ENVR411","ENVR411","ENVR411","ENVR411","ENVR411","ENVR","ENVR411","ENVR411"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWESOME","AVERAGE"]}}]
