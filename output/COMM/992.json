He is very friendly and new everyone's name in the class in 3 days. He is willing to help and explain concepts if you take the initiative. There is a lot of reading, which I didn't do... When he gives an essay make sure you ask him exactly what he wants!!! very unclear about essays.","Great class. I liked his laid back lecturing style. Even though the class was fairly large, he was very good a encouraging discussion. Exams are fairly easy. However, you have to write two long papers, and the TAs are tough graders.","Loved professor Balthrop - One of the best professors I have had thus far at UNC, definitely worth taking this class. Laid back and discussion based.","i loved dr. balthrop! i can't believe the people below complained about him! he's extremely well informed on the subject and class is more about discussion than grades. he is so laid back and very approachable. i wish i could take another class with him!","interesting class, great teacher. very laid back guy, just wants his students to learn something not focused on tests and grades.","Dr. Balthrop is great! The class was a freshman seminar about Ireland. Very interesting and he is very informed on the subject. He's a fair grader and funny guy. He's more interested in students learning rather than getting perfect test scores. One of my favorite classes and professors.","one of my favorite professors...it's obvious that he loves what he teaches.  also not a tough grader-- i missed quite a bit of class and managed a b.  a friendly guy who remembers his students and genuinely cares.","One of the worst professors you could ever hope to meet.  He pretends to be open minded about social issues but refuses to listen to anyone's opinion in class.  Avoid at all costs.","Phenomenal teacher, very interesting and fun.  Best I have had in college","He can't teach worth %$@#, one of the worst teachers and classes that I have ever had including high school.","This is by far the worst class I have taken here.  I am a junior currently.  The course title is Rhetoric and Social Controversy"],"courses":["COMM89","COMM374","COMM372","COMM071","COMM071","COMM071","COMM170","COMM","COMM135","COMM70","COMM70"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWFUL","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR"]}}]
