Imagine Dr. Phil and Oprah have a tree-hugging love child. That is Todd Taylor, or as he will make you call him, Coach Todd, because as he says himself, \"I, ladies and gentlemen, will be your life coach from here on out.\" This is English 105, this is a joke class. He is no joke, this guy grades harshly. So much unnecessary work.","cool man","Coach Todd Taylor was the best professor I've had, and probably will ever have, at UNC. You will walk out of his classroom and see writing in a whole new perspective. Coach makes you work, but you will be grateful in the end. He is well-respected in the UNC English Department. I cannot be more thankful for taking this class.","You will not get an A","Todd is a cool dude, but he's so knowledgeable about films and expects you to be too. Class is easy during the semester, but the final and midterm are painful. Would say it was incredibly interesting and fun! Would recommend","I didn't really enjoy English before taking his class, but after I really enjoyed writing. He takes up time with his students in mandatory office hours helping you with your writing. If you put forth effort in the writing assignments, and show improvement you will be fine. If you make your writing personal, you will get a good grade.","Class is definitely worth taking but not an easy A.  You need to study for the exams-which are painstakingly LONG! I actually don't know what kind of professor he is because he rarely addresses the class.  Discussion takes place in recitation, led by a TA.  Films are hit and miss and several directors are repeats. Diversity would be nice.","fun elective class.  gain new appreciation for film.  professor is awesome!","AMAAAAAAAAAAZING.  awesome and amazing. mister todd taylor is the most incredible, GENIUS, creative, interesting, hilarious, influential people in the entire university.  take this class.  it'll change your life, i swear.  you will learn so much and love film so much more because you will begin to watch them from an entirely different perspective.  HE IS AWESOME.","ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE CLASS!!!! Work load was great and I felt all the assignments were beneficial esp. recreating a scene from a film. Tests were long but not too difficult if you actually watched the films.","No Comments"],"courses":["ENGL105","ENG","ENGL105","ENGL105","ENGL142","ENGL101","ENGL142","ENGL142","MOVIECRITICISM","MOVIECRIT","ENG"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
