Clinically, the man is BRILLIANT. The vocal exercises work wonders if you KEEP AT IT. Practice journals are dumb, but would also work wonders IF we used them properly! Sparks is brilliant, but wear a tough skin & get ready to be awesome!","Mr. Sparks can be tough, but he is brilliant. Some people don't work well with him, but he can really do wonders for young voice students.","His exercises are not very helpful and are quite odd. He make you feel like you wont amount to your full potential and grades unfairly. He is not very understanding and has been know to make ppl cry. Probably b/c he is never satisfied. I recommend another voice teacher.","This is a class that is riddled with pointless exercises and little interaction.  Instead of helping individuals with diction problems, Sparks instead suses group exercises, which are completely unhealpful for individual singers.  Very boring and unengaging.  Better learn German diction from and individual voice teacher."],"courses":["VOICE000","VOICESECT","VOICESECT","MUSC061"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWFUL"]}}]
