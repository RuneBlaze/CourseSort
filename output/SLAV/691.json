You have to be decent at writing to do well though. Overall just show up most of the time and write the papers and read/skim the books and you'll get an A","Pichova is extremely nice and helpful.","My 2nd class with Pichova; she carefully chooses readings and helps you analyze and understand them. My non-lit-major friends had a hard time with her grading, b/c there are 2 essay tests and a paper. But she's hilarious and wants you to do well, and creates a great class atmosphere for discussion. If you're into lit/slavic things, take her class!","Such a sweetheart! Classes set up kind of like a book club: she does a close reading of the text and anyone can chime in when they want (but she also doesn't care if you don't talk). Reading is very manageable and interesting. She is hilarious and brilliant and always willing to talk outside of class.

She will certainly pique your interest in the Russian language and culture. She cares for her students and is very passionate about teaching. Take Russian with her!!!","SHE IS SO GREAT!  SO funny and soooo nice! Willing to help you whenever you need it! Genuinely cares about all of her students! Study for the tests and they are not very hard. I'm terrible at any and all foreign languages and I did very well in RUSS 101. Take her class!","She is absolutely amazing, I lover her and wish I could have her for every class at UNC.  She makes the material fun to learn, and her personality can't be beat","Eleonora is the best professor at UNC! She is really funny and is a lenient grader. She understands if you are busy and will push back quizzes and tests for you. If you have a chance to take Russ 101 with her do it!","Excellent teacher who constantly makes you laugh. Not an easy class but definitely worth taking, she wants you to succeed.","Love Eleanora! Specifically signed up for her class cos I'd heard good things about her. She's funny & will help you if you struggle. She calls on students regularly, so you have to pay attention. HW is to be handed in every lesson, which got old fast lol. She grades very generously though. Found her class very worthwhile & made my semester shine.","Eleonora is highly entertaining and engaging. I absolutely love her! I really enjoy going to this class and she is very understanding about circumstances keeping you from class. She is very willing to help you with material outside of class. Genuinely excited about the material.","Absolutely loved her. One of the best professors I've had in any subject! Hilarious and extremely fun. Pretty easy class too.","She is a little crazy, but very entertaining. I've never had a professor who cares so much about her students!","Eleonora is the most amazing teacher!

Lapushin is the bomb. Super easy grader and fantastic, interesting lectures. If you ever get the chance to take a class with him DO IT. One of the best professors at UNC.","Hands-down, one of the best professors I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I took one class with him my third semester at Carolina and took another my fourth and fifth semesters here! He inspired me to change my major to Russian and Slavic Language and Culture and has been there to guide me every step of the way! Take a class with him!","I had Lapushin for a first year seminar, Madness and (Russian) Lit. Class is almost entirely discussion-based with only a little bit of highly informal lecture. By the end of the semester I was wishing he would lecture more because he is SO GOOD at it--he is engaging and inspiring. Also, he's very easy at least in a FYS. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","Really passionate about the subject. Helpful, enthusiastic, and engaging. Take his class!","Awesome prof - dedicated, enthusiastic, very russian :) class was a joy","The best professor at UNC.","So enthusiastic and entertaining! Lots of reading, but he never gives reading quizzes. Not the easiest paper grader, but not too difficult and he offers help","Professor Lapushin is the hidden jem of UNC. He is the best professor I've ever had. His passion and excitement for what he teaches makes every class worth attending just so you can hear him talk. Sometimes he'll act out scenes from what we're reading and drop to his knees. He is super nice and really wants his students to do well. Take his classes","Read the other reviews. Lapushin is the best professor at UNC, bar none. He sometimes has a habit of talking over students, but only because he gets so excited over books. He's like one of those professors from movies that ends up changing your perspective on the world. Take a class with this man before you graduate. And UNC: tenure this man!","Easily one of the best professors I have had at UNC.  I'm a math major, but after taking a russian literature class from Professor Lapushin, I have a genuine interest in the subject.  Lapushin makes virtually every reading fascinating.  He is also an incredibly nice and helpful person.","Great professor.  His passion for books and reading is infectious.  He helps you to see and understand literature in completely new ways.  He's also genuinely a nice person and concerned with every student's performance in the class.  Take him!","The best professor I've ever had.","Simply put, he is the man.","Absolutely phenomenal professor.  I don't care what your major is, don't leave Carolina without taking a course with this man.  He is brilliant, helpful, and extremely funny.  Russian literature comes to life when he's at the helm.  In fact, just let Lapushin teach everything.","I LOVE THIS MAN! he is funny, very passionate, and really makes us get down to the bottom of the question during class discussions. always pushes us to understand the text better. there are only two papers and two exams, the rest is reading and discussion. oh, and prepare for the best Russian accent you will ever hear.","One of the funniest and intelligent professors ever.  He truly knows exactly what he's talking about and is ALWAYS available to help out if you feel you need it at all.  He's got great passion for Russian Literature and will truly help you enjoy the subject matter!!","No Comments"],"courses":["RUSS465","RUSS450","SLAV86","465","RUSS465","RUSS81","SLAV86","RUSS442","RUSS432","RUSS140","RUSS270","RUSS281","RUSS281","RUSS281","RUSS270","RUSS270","RUSS270"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}},{"subject":"SLAV","catalog_nbr":691,"section":23,"class_nbr":13346,"title":"HONORS-READING","component":"Lecture","units":3,"bldg":"TBA","room":"TBA","days":"TBA","time":"TBA","instructor":"REESE,KEVIN M","load":"100","rank":"TA","attributes":["E"],"enrl_cap":2,"enrl_tot":0,"wait_cap":0,"wait_tot":0,"prereqs":null,"rmp":{"url":"http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1265519","fname":"Kevin","lname":"Reese","quality":"4.2","easiness":"3.5","help":"3.5","clarity":"3.5","topTag":"Gives good feedback (1)","grade":"3.5","university":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","chili":"new-hot","tags":["INSPIRATIONAL","CLEAR GRADING CRITERIA"],"comments":["One of the best teachers you'll ever have.","Loves to quote Pushkin.
