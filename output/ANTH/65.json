Gives clear lectures and does not over-complicate things. Five assignments based on relatively short readings. One midterm and a final. Tests are entirely based on what he says in lecture. Although archaeology is not my area of study, I found this class to be relevant and interesting. Worth your time if you need an ANTH credit.","I love Professor Arbuckle! He's so much fun and makes the class really interesting. He's dedicated to the subject matter and often talks about research he has done. I don't think I went a single class without laughing at something he did or said. You have to read articles and write 1-page summaries on them but its not too bad! Love this guy!","Benjamin is a baller. He is so good at archaeology and makes his lectures super easy to understand. The class is stupid easy, but it's so interesting that you WANT to pay attention. The tests are ridiculously easy, and he's just a really cool guy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone to meet this guy and take this class.","Professor Arbuckle is very straightforward with his class policies and expectations. As long as you go to class, do the minimal amount of homework, and study for the tests it should be an easy A.  He is very passionate about archaeology and makes little jokes to make lecture more interesting. Would always recommend this class!","This guy is my favorite teacher.  He's really funny, helpful, and clearly passionate about the subject.  You have to write one page summaries for every class but they're not that bad and he is very fair.  10/10 would take again."],"courses":["ANTH233","ANTH65","ANTH149","ANTH149","ANTH65"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
