Lectures are long and he is prone to tangents that won't be on the final. He doesn't respond to emails and most of the grades rely on \"participation\" when he lectures all class. He refers to female students as \"coeds\". Nice guy, but not a great prof.","Just be attentive, ask questions and act like you care, he will take notice. You may have no idea what order you are learning or what he wants, but if you make effort and understand the main concepts of the course you will be fine.","Took a lower level class from him before and he was boring, but in this discussion class, he was very engaging and I learned more in this class than I have from any other in college. If you take him, make sure it's a higher level course.","His lectures are extremely boring, and he tends to ramble about a lot of stuff that will never be on the exam. He also assigns a ton of reading. His exams are open-ended but very easy as long as you understand the main topics he is talking about and go to recitation and class.","He is boring in class and it is hard to keep your attention but in office hours he is very engaging and informative. Easy class though.","Boring class, but not difficult","He deviates from the lecture material and goes off on these off topic, unrelated tangents.  There is NO standard for how he or his TA's grade the exams.  I still can't decide which was less useful, the lecture or the recitation.  I ended up getting a B but left the class with nothing more than  a complete disdain for the field of anthropology.","Beware, he will spend an entire class period rambling off topic, essentially wasting your time. He grades horribly: does not grade on correctness, but on whether or not he likes how you say it. I honestly didn't learn anything from this class.","Lectures have nothing to do with what you are talking about.","One of the easiest classes ive taken at Carolina. Its not the most interesting class (its really boring) but the exam questions are broad so if you are good at writing essay the class should be fairly easy. Just go to recitation and look over the powerpoint slides (which are all online) and you will do fine.","this class was absolutely the most boring class i have ever been to! everyone pretty much looked dead in class because it was that dreadful and no one paid attention...thanks to aim and facebook. and even if you studied and went over his powerpoints and read the book your answers to his tests were never specific enough! so frustrating!","He is not exciting, at all.","His classes were soooo boring! He put way too much info on each slide and over 50 slides per class; when he got close to the end of class he would rush through and skip things.  Not a good professor at all!  In a huge lecture class, he gave open ended questions... how ridiculous!","I loved the way he taught, and he was very enthusiastic about the subject matter.  He posted the notes online, and they were very helpful.  Knowledgable and fair grader.  If you study the power points, you should be fine, and he gives study guides and the tests are not extremely difficult","This class is dreadfully boring. The exam material is not covered well in class. He grades insanely hard, so even if your answers comes straight from the book, you will still get a C+ on his exams","increadibly boring class. tests extremely specific.","The class is extremely boring.  No one actually pays attention to his lectures.  Everyone is either on AIM or on Facebook.  Seriously, if you want a class that is exciting, do not take this class because it is downright opposite of exciting.  Also, his tests can be hard","No Comments","inhumanely boring.","class is so boring. the whole lecture is him reading from his powerpoints, which are put onto blackboard. There's no real reason to go to class. Exams are hard and are free response. You have to know A LOT of specific material."],"courses":["ANTH291","ANTH468","ANTH456","ANTH145","ANTH145","ANTHR145","ANTH101","ANTH220","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH350","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","HIST101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH10"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE","POOR","GOOD","POOR","POOR","AVERAGE","AWESOME","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","POOR","GOOD"]}}]
