Class format is just running through his class note, which is his version of condensed textbook but it's not easy to read. He seems ill-prepared for class and is anything but clarity for  lecture. I learned more from visiting TA than from class. He's nice personally tho. take MATH 381 instead of this","A super nice guy and even a little funny when I bothered to go to class. The biggest problem was the tests being too short, can you believe it... it would make a small mistake on any part hinder your grade too much, but otherwise Plaisted was a pretty easy a.","David Plaisted does not teach. He reads his notes in front of the class for 90 minutes, twice a week. The quizzes and tests from previous years are online, and they do not change from year to year. Getting an A requires no knowledge, only memorization. If you want an easy A, take COMP 455 with him, if you want to learn, take it with someone else.","He's the man","Easy class as it is very straight forward. Tests include a lot of true/false. Random pop quizzes to ensure attendance.","way too far behind on comp sci to be a real comp sci teacher, Very Nice Guy though","2-3 tests + a final exam. Pretty straightforward homework and random quizzes are given for attendance purposes. He's way too fond of multiple choice and true/false for automata theory."],"courses":["COMP283","COMP455","COMP455","COMP455","COMP455","COMP445","COMP455"],"courseRatings":["AWFUL","GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AVERAGE"]}}]
