YOU WON'T PASS.","LECTURE HEAVY","TOUGH GRADER"],"comments":["Had Kieber for the 2nd half of BIO 202, and it was a rude awakening after Hogan. He was poorly organized and his slides were difficult to follow. He didn't explain concepts well at all, and sometimes concepts he said wouldn't be on the exam showed up anyways. Did not answer multiple emails. He doesn't seem interested in teaching. Avoid if possible!","Awesome prof! He goes really fast but is willing to slow down if you let him know. There's a lot of info we have to know for the exam, but the midterm wasn't tricky (haven't taken final yet). Only grades are midterm, a project, and a final. Even though he posts the power points on Sakai, you need to go to class in order to do well on the exam","lectures are rambling and pointless, you you'd better go for your poll everywhere grade, which I didn't sometimes and suffered. leaves you with substitutes randomly, who are actually better lecturers. The exams are traps to see if you are an expert in the confusing subject matter. He says it wont cover things we didn't cover, but it's a lie.","Dr. Kieber is the worst professor I have had at UNC. His lectures are boring, he rambles and is super unclear about the material, and he is kind of a smart ass in office hours. He constantly told us in class to not worry about the small details but still tested us on those details. Smart guy but he should stick to research. NOT a good teacher!","I love Kieber. He's very enthusiastic and he makes great lame jokes. His lectures are entertaining. Yeah, he goes fast, but if you take notes and put in some time outside of class you'll be okay. Definitely highly recommend him if you're interested in genetics. I hated Hogan's half (way boring) and loved his.","Dr. Kieber is really smart but you can tell he's a professor because he wants to do research not because he wants to teach. He's kind of awkward and goofy but overall a nice guy. He goes over material quickly so I suggest recording lectures. His tests are really straightforward but not the easiest. Overall not a bad choice for 202.","He's a good professor and an approachable guy.  Study the material from lecture hard and you'll do fine in the class.  Don't worry so much about the textbook; work practice problems from the recitation.","Kieber teaches the second half of Bio 202. He has a lot of energy, however because he must cover such a large amount of material, he is often times VERY unclear about what he's trying to say. Almost to the point of frustration. Be prepared to read the textbook or spend a long time teaching yourself the material. Overall a hard class in general.","first off, the class is curved. the averages for all the exams are generally in the low 60s. without a curve, statistically, the average grade is a D-. That being said its hard to dislike dr. kieber because hes so enthusiastic and is a nice guy overall, but he tries to cover far too much material to be testing on such small details.","YOU NEED TO ATTEND EVERY CLASS!!! otherwise ur gonna regret a lot afterwards b/c the exams are really detailed.personally, had hard time following his lecture. but, some ppl liked his style.","I thought Kieber would be straightfwd, b/c at first he made it clear what was expected.Nice guy, but his teaching style did not work for me.  His combined final with Hogan was VERY DETAILED and cummulative.  I thought for sure teh class would be curved, or the lowest test dropped, but niether happend, and your grade was just your grade.  GOOD LUCK!","HARD class!  I would just avoid it if you can.  I had to email him to ask questions a few times, and he never responded.  He seems like a nice intelligent guy and I'm sure he works for some people, but he moves through the material very quickly.","he's a great professor... you work, but end up KNOWING the material.  he'll also go out of his way to write you a letter of recommendation, if you ask.","HE TALKS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND TALKS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AND TALKZZzzzzzzzzzz.... (=_=). Do the reading and HW, and don't forget to bring your pillow."],"courses":["BIOL202","BIOL439","BIOL202","BIOL202001","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIO202","BIOL202","BIOL50","ADVCELLBIO","BIOL050"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","POOR","AWESOME","GOOD"]}}]
