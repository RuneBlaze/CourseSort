One 4 problem homework assignment a week.  You don't have to go to class because his lectures are straight from the textbook, but I still found it helpful to attend his lectures.  You don't even have to show up to turn in homework, you can just leave it in his office.  Super chill guy, easy material.","Professor Ziya teaches straight from the textbook, and he assigns little homework. 90% of your grade is from the two midterms and the final, so you have to prepare well for your exams! He curves at the end. He's very nice and will help if you ask BUT you have to put in the effort to ask. Lectures do seem long, but overall he's a decent professor!","Professor Ziya is such a nice guy! His lectures can be a little boring and very long, but he will do anything to make sure you understand the material, and he is very accommodating. I had to register during one of our exams, so he let me take the exam at a different time! Such a nice guy!","Contents of lectures are exactly the same as those on the textbook. No help on doing homework or exams."],"courses":["STOR151","STOR151","STOR151","STOR641"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWFUL"]}}]
