He's pretty monotonous and there is very little class engagement which makes it really hard to pay attention. If you study the power points though, the tests really aren't that difficult. As far as science professors go he was pretty good just not that interesting.","I enjoyed Professor Slep's lectures, but it's definitely not for everyone. He can be kind of monotone and not very exciting, but he covers the material well and will help if it is needed. His awkward jokes make the class more enjoyable, but his tests are very difficult, but they are doable if you thoroughly know the material. You WILL have to work.","His smoother than glass lectures make his co-instructors sound like bumbling fools. Tests will be hard for most, balance between understanding fundamentals and paying attention to lecture specifics. Hence, attendance is rewarded.","Test are long and too difficult compared to lectures and hw.","My fellow students, avoid Dr. Slep.  He gives tests that are nearly impossible to finish.  What's more, he told us before he even started teaching his section of the course that he didn't like the subject matter.  I'm a successful biology major right now, but this guy (first bio class I took at UNC) almost scared me away from the major entirely.",""],"courses":["BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202","BIOL202"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE"]}}]
