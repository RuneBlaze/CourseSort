She is nice and easy to talk to. We had a unit on the Black Lives Matter movement and it was included on a test we had on class material- which I thought was rather subjective. She is v opinionated on things and sometimes it is overbearing. Should keep political opinions off of class tests","Sara is an amazing teacher and person, I absolutely loved going the her class. Though the class is quite bias towards liberal ideas the class discusses both sides of the issue. The papers were very interesting and not difficult at all. I HIGHLY recommend first years to take this course.","Great professor. Workload is manageable and exams are pretty easy. Very approachable and is always willing to help if you need it. Recommended!","Her lectures were not very clear and generally you're just fine if you view her ppts (which are online) and read the text book. I've already taken the class and I'm still not too sure what the class is even about. She's passionate, but not a great instructor. Pretty easy class. I failed one of the exams (due  to laziness) & still ended up w/ a B","Sara was a great professor. The lectures covered a lot of material, but you could tell that she was passionate about geography. Tests are hard, but projects help bring your grade up. To do well, you have to go to class and keep up with the reading!","Sara is the best. She's very passionate and helpful, and dedicated to explaining geographic concepts to those of us who aren't majors. Class was pretty straightforward, wasn't too hard, and the material was interesting. I would take another class with her!"],"courses":["GEOG120","GEOG89","ASIA267","GEOG120","GEOG120","GEOG267"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
