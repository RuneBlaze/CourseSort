When taking his class, you learn so much about the course material, but more importantly, so much about yourself. Molakisi Fhunsu impacted my life in ways he will never realize.","You get out what you put into this class. Dr. Fhunsu gives great feedback on papers which is why he takes so long to return them. The books chosen are interesting and open you to new perspectives. Make sure you read, his quizzes incorporate tiny details from the book. Also he makes the environment comfortable for learning but you must participate,","A truly sweet man, but his lectures don't have much to do with the literature, he likes to get into debates with students for the sake of it. I loved the books he assigned, but got nothing out of class discussion. His quizzes and tests focus on tiny details of the books rather than their larger themes.","So Dr. Fhunsu is one of the most intelligent people I have talked to at UNC. His knowledge expands way beyond the class, and clarifies anything said in class if you talk to him after. His class is a bit tough compared to other classes as you need to do some critical thinking, but as long as he can see good quality in your work, you'll be fine!","Dr. Fhunsu is one of the most intelligent professors at UNC. You can see that he cares about the topics he teaches, and is very understanding of the students. Class was hard and the final was extremely comprehensive, but the knowledge gained is huge. Take this class with him, you won't regret it!","He is a genuinely kind person who cares if you learn. The class is pretty easy, I highly recommend it."],"courses":["LGLA404","AAAD200","AAAD201","AAAD200","AAAD200","AFRI262"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","POOR","AWESOME","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
