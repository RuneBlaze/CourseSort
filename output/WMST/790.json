Online quizzes give you a good cushion and the midterm and final were easy if you did what you were supposed to in class. Not too much interaction with Vigil because its  a large lecture class, so home you get a good TA. Reflections are really easy too.","Dr. Vigil's class was one of my favorites that I've taken here so far. She is very passionate about the course matter and takes the class very seriously. The class isn't difficult, and the material is interesting.","This class was the most ridiculous class I've ever taken because she made it based off of her published book she wrote.  She graded insanely hard on very good papers and didn't offer any POSITIVE criticism, just cut you down time and time again if you didn't write subjectively.   I will never take another course with her.","Dr. Vigil was so passionate about the subject and made class interesting. Very professional and respectable but also approachable and friendly. Favorite professor at UNC","Dr. Vigil was a pleasant and nice! The class was huge so everything you do is through your TA, she doesn't grade a single thing you do. That being said, it really matters what TA you have and how your recitations go. The reading never was too much and none of the assignments were ever ridiculous. It just matters if your TA likes what you write.","She is never very specific about what she expects on her papers and isn't very willing to give feedback.","Amazing and inspirational professor. Lectures are super interesting and covered a wide variety of social justice issues.","Professor Vigil gives interesting lectures. The TAs, are relatively easy graders but the course is super interesting. I would highly recommend this class."],"courses":["WMST101","WMST101","WMST281","WMST101","WMST101","WMST233","WMST","WMST101"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
