Her edits are so extensive that you will wonder if she even thought you understood the assignment, and that is for an A paper! However, I learned more from her than from any other prof at UNC.","She requires a massive amount of reading that I assume most people did not bother with.  She is a stickler for grammar on the four papers.  No final exam though!","Interesting subject for ANTH or INTS majors.  Must read, go to class, and pay attention.  Essay topics are vague, but if you are interested in anthropology it they are not difficult to write, just make sure they are analysis based.","I would not recommend this class to anyone. Not only is it boring and completely unorganized, she is unable to communicate her thoughts effectively. This is my biggest complaint. The class is based on four essays. Each essay prompt is more vague then the next. You don't know what it is that she wants. HORRIBLE! DO NOT TAKE CLASSES WITH HER!","Her section of Introduction to International Studies was blatantly anti-American and anti-capitalism.  On our final exam, we basically had to describe for two hours why the United States was the cause of all the world's problems.","Don't bother- no matter how hard you try, it won't be right (i.e. HER opinion)"],"courses":["294","ANTH375","ANTH375","ANTH375","INTS","SEASIA"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","POOR","GOOD","AWFUL","POOR","POOR"]}}]
