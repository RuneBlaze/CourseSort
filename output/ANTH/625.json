Charles was such a cool (and easy!) teacher and I loved coming to class despite it being my 5th class of the day. His lectures were entertaining because he is so passionate and knowledgeable on the subject. He offers lots of extra credit that add points to your final grade. Super cool!","Reasonably clear lectures, does ramble at times, can be rather boring.  Assigns a lot of reading.  Does not go out of his way to meet students, but will help if you visit his office hours.  Tests are a bit difficult, but he gives extra credit if you attend recitations.  Can be intimidating, but is very fair and reasonable, sometimes funny","Not a very good professor. His lectures are pointless, the textbook and readings are all you need to pass. The only good TA is Eric Thomas, the others are awful and snobby. The lectures are so boring and Price uses vocab he makes off from the top of his head. Plus he makes you buy his own book which is completely irrelevant to the class.","Nice guy but avoid taking him if you can!! I wish I would have read these and taken West instead (who I hear is amazing).  His power points do not make any sense, his test are hard, even when you study and he counts the 2 tests and 1 essay as 90 percent of your grade with no willingness to help if you score badly on one (or both).  AVOID HIM!!!","THE LECTURES ARE VERY INTERESTING. HE MAKES THEM FUN AND IS GENUINELY CONCERNED WITH YOU LEARNING/LIKING THE MATERIAL. HE IS A LITTLE CONFUSING, AND HIS POWERPOINT SLIDES DON'T EXPAND ENOUGH TO TRULY HELP. THE TESTS ARE TOUGH, BUT IF YOU MAKE SURE YOU READ AND RE-READ THEN YOU SHOULD DO FINE.","Dr. Price is a great professor. He is not only passionate about his work, he is also a very nice person. The class was fairly easy and extra credit was offered throughout the semester","Price's lectures are very boring and the tests are unnecessarily hard.  There are so many very long readings that are also very boring.  Would NEVER recommend this class with this professor","There's no point in coming to class. He is confusing and boring and the exams aren't hard but we never learned about anything exciting. His Rastafarian book is horrible and he constantly rants about race.","Typical introductory course. Okay lectures, decent tests, decent textbook. Essays help your grade. To do well, read textbooks and posted readings and review powerpoints.","I dreaded this class. I didnt care about it AT ALL, and that's probs why I came out with a C. After studying my butt off for the first 2 tests and only receiving 80, i started to give up. The tests werent even that hard...it really doesnt make any sense. He never gives the tests back. Gives you extra credit essays, but TAs are sucky graders.","The class was pretty interesting. If you're willing to read all assigned reading thoroughly, you can definitely get an A. Although it's hard not to fall asleep in many lectures, He's very nice and tries to keep students engaged.","Prof. Price is a pretty cool guy.  If you study for his tests, you will do well on them.  STUDY THE ARTICLES, NOT JUST THE BOOK.  He also assigns a book assignment concerning the Rastafari.  Also he gives an option for a huge amount of extra credit.  Plus, the guy has really long dreadlocks.  I got an A in the class, and so can you.","Professor Price is my favorite professor this semester. He is a really cool guy, very down to earth, and I never have a problem staying awake in his class. The lectures are very interesting, as are most of the readings. However, the Rastafarian book was NOT good.","The guy himself is awesome. Real cool outlook, has Rastafarian traits, etc. but he is a complex lecturer...tests are somewhat average if you study. TA's are useless. Didn't take attendance for recitations so I never went. Lectures = boring.","Lectures are boring and hard to follow and take notes. In addition to the textbook, he assigns many additional readings and this long and boring rastafarian book.  However, there is only one paper and it is only 2 pages.  You can also do another paper for extra credit.  Also, all exams are 50 easy multiple choice questions.","I liked the guy, hes a rastafarian guys with 5 ft dreadlocks and i actually found the subject intersting. it changed my outlook on society. never used either book,lost them both. He is hard to follow and is scatterbrained but just show up and take notes on what you can discern from the lectures, you'll be fine. 4 hrs studying prior to test- easy B","ANTH 101 is not Price's forte. He said, on day 1, he hadn't taught 101 in awhile. So I understood the--subpar lectures. BUT, the textbook for 101 is VERY interesting and I would highly recommend taking ANTH 101.  Dr. Price may not be the lecturer for you if you want to be enveloped in class everyday. His class is easy.  I got a B.  Read & study ppt","DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  it is terrible, he is SO boring. he rarely uses powerpoint and just gets up there and talks about GOD KNOWS WHAT.  he doesn't really use the book either, so you can't really follow along on your own.  oh, and my TA neither spoke nor understood ANY english...so recitation was a complete and utter waste of my life.","AVOID THIS PROFESSOR!!! Taking this class with Dr. Price will teach you more about racism and the hardships blacks have to endure rather than anything about Anthropology. His lectures are annoying and filled with vocabulary he seemed to create spontaneously. Just don't do it man! Wait to take this course with another teacher!!","He was super boring, hard to follow, and it seemed like he made up the lectures as he went. The class was a waste of my time. TAs are really helpful, though!"],"courses":["ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH101","ANTH10"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AVERAGE","GOOD","GOOD","POOR","AWFUL","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AWFUL","POOR","AWFUL"]}}]
