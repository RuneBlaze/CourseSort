The course material doesn't exactly lend itself to fascination, but Kurzman is clear and explains exactly what you need to know. The exams aren't bad as long as you listen to his instructions and they are open book so be sure to take notes verbatim. He is great.","I guess he hasn't taught this in a few years, but he must've gotten better because he is AMAZING. Generally this would be a super boring course, but Kurzman makes it simple, clear and to the point. He grades kind of hard, but it willing to work with you. Learned so much, which I needed as a soci major.","I loved this class. The subject matter can seem obscure at times (Foucault, Haraway, etc) but Kurzman's lectures are engaging and clear. However, the TA's were painfully out of sync with the material. As long as you do all the work, an A is guaranteed. Definitely worth it.","No Comments","No Comments","No Comments","Interesting guy, but I found the class boring and a lot of petty work.  The service learning compenent made the class interesting, but added greatly to the time I put into it.  Definitely need to keep up on the reading and be very involved in class.  Our class was too big to have good projects/teach class/discuss as we were supposed to.","Do the readings and you're ok! Very interesting class and he's a cool guy."],"courses":["SOCI250","SOCI250","SOCI250","SOC810","SOC810","SOCI51","SOCI68","SOCI50"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWFUL","AWFUL","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
