He seems to give few instructions at the beginning, and lets you run with your design ideas. He'll guide you along the way with the helpful, but often annoying Socratic method. Don't worry too much about your grade. Do what he asks to the best of your ability and it will be ok.","I liked this class. He is passionate about BME, but he needs to be more understanding of beginner students, especially because my class was an introductory design class. His test is hard. He wont really help you in an other way than telling you to \"read the documents.\" For the circuit project, you either get a 0 or 100."],"courses":["BMME310","BMME210"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
