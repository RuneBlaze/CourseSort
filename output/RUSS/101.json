She will certainly pique your interest in the Russian language and culture. She cares for her students and is very passionate about teaching. Take Russian with her!!!","SHE IS SO GREAT!  SO funny and soooo nice! Willing to help you whenever you need it! Genuinely cares about all of her students! Study for the tests and they are not very hard. I'm terrible at any and all foreign languages and I did very well in RUSS 101. Take her class!","She is absolutely amazing, I lover her and wish I could have her for every class at UNC.  She makes the material fun to learn, and her personality can't be beat","Eleonora is the best professor at UNC! She is really funny and is a lenient grader. She understands if you are busy and will push back quizzes and tests for you. If you have a chance to take Russ 101 with her do it!","Excellent teacher who constantly makes you laugh. Not an easy class but definitely worth taking, she wants you to succeed.","Love Eleanora! Specifically signed up for her class cos I'd heard good things about her. She's funny & will help you if you struggle. She calls on students regularly, so you have to pay attention. HW is to be handed in every lesson, which got old fast lol. She grades very generously though. Found her class very worthwhile & made my semester shine.","Eleonora is highly entertaining and engaging. I absolutely love her! I really enjoy going to this class and she is very understanding about circumstances keeping you from class. She is very willing to help you with material outside of class. Genuinely excited about the material.","Absolutely loved her. One of the best professors I've had in any subject! Hilarious and extremely fun. Pretty easy class too.","She is a little crazy, but very entertaining. I've never had a professor who cares so much about her students!","Eleonora is the most amazing teacher!  She's hilarious and sweet and really cares about the material.  If you're having any trouble, she's more than willing to help you.  The best teacher and I highly highly recommend her!  She makes Russian so much fun!","Great professor, great class!  Highly recommend!","Very entertaining and funny in class.  Keeps you engaged.  Very helpful outside of class if you don't understand the material.  She's very sweet and just an interesting person in general.","Probably one of the most interesting characters in the Slavic Studies Department.
