We only had one test, the midterm, and it was hard but the other projects you do he grades fairly easy.","Since he knows his stuff, Professor Hollins makes his tests extremely detailed, so make sure you study the book, go to class, and look over the lecture power points if you want to pass. One of the worst professors I've had at Carolina. Definitely wouldn't recommend.","Condescending","Don't take this class. His voice is boring and monotonous, so it's extremely hard to stay interested. Tests are extremely detailed, and you have to read the every single page of the textbook if you expect an A.","Hollins is a good professor. Knows his material. Very clear about what he is teaching - straightforward. His tests are relatively easy so long as you study AND read the textbook. Know how to explain things and not just spit out vocab. A lot of times he's reaaaally monotonous, so be prepared to force yourself awake during class. Overall, good.","Doctor Hollins is very nice and means well, but his tests are really hard and detailed. I really enjoy this teacher as a person, but as far as the class goes I wouldn't recommend taking it."],"courses":["PSYC67","225","225","225","PSYC225H","PSYC225"],"courseRatings":["AVERAGE","AWFUL","AWFUL","POOR","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
