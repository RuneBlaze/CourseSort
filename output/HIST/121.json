You probably won't get help from Hampton but the TAs are pretty good. Interesting lectures but long in the T/TH class. Good teacher though.","This professor is great.  The lectures are pretty interesting.  The midterm is a little tricky but other than that the class is enjoyable.  There are only 2 short papers and a final paper which is nothing but literally putting your notes into sentences.  Great Professor, I definitly recommend!","You don't have a book so everything comes from lecture. He calls his mid-term the Great Leveler. The final is a paper and the papers aren't too bad. Definitely recommend him","Nice teacher. Alright Class. Lectures are clear and organized but extremely boring. 1 test - hard to understand and tricky. The papers are easy. Do good on the midterm and you'll be set for the class.","Not a lot of reading, lectures semi-engaging. Pretty interesting for a history class!
