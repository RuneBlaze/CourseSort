Make sure you get a good TA if you take her. Recitation is your only chance to learn what you need for the exams. The TAs also grade the exams and some grade significantly harder than others so beware.","Having a good TA is key - go to the class, do the readings and you will be FINE.  I like her - she def. knows what she's talking about!!!","Dull lectures with a monotone voice.  Does not know how to use a microphone.  Tests are not that bad, but everything is graded by your T.A.  If you have a tough T.A. you're screwed.","Boring class...most people either fall asleep or play cards on their computer. Make sure you get a good TA for this class, they will be the only ones you actually learn anything from","A fairly interesting teacher with a neat accent.  Lectures are decent and attendance isn't mandatory but there is not textbook and no posting of the notes, so it's pretty important to come.  Tests aren't that difficult.  The main thing is to find a decent TA.  Overall a pretty interesting class, I would recommend it.","No Comments"],"courses":["POLI239","POLI239","POLI239","POLI239","POLI239","POLI239"],"courseRatings":["POOR","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","AVERAGE","GOOD","AVERAGE"]}}]
