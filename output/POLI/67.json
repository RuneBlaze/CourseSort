YOU WON'T PASS."],"comments":["Professor Reynolds was amazing! I would highly suggest taking him if you're a poli-sci major. He is very knowledgable, not only because he's studied these places, but because he's traveled to them as well. If you pay attention and do the readings you'll see how he compares governments & countries. A good TA helps too.","Reynolds is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, but there didn't seem to be clear takeaways from his powerpoints and lectures. It felt more like a history class than comparative politics. Readings are long and boring.","He is amazing!  An incredibly interesting person and a great lecturer.  I enjoyed the class and it has been one of my favorites at UNC.  I would highly recommend, even if you are not a Political Science major.","Super nice guy, makes an otherwise boring subject pretty interesting. The british accent doesn't hurt too. The tests were straight forward and consistent, I got a B+ and never did the readings and never studied more than an hour for the tests.","This class was very interesting. There were also essentially no readings and only two five-page essays. The grading is sketchy, though: it seems geared toward giving everyone a B and making it very hard to get an A.","Reynolds was obviously very experienced in his subject, and that definitely showed during his lectures. However, I really expected this class to be more about comparative political systems, when it seemed like a history lecture every day. Readings are boring and long, and Reynold's powerpoints are not always clear and he does not post them.","Great teacher. Engaging, really values learning over grades/tests. Concerned with big picture stuff, not nitty gritty details. Really, really knows his stuff. Cool guy, very fair and reasonable. Readings are not included on exams. If you attend lecture exams are pretty straight forward. Not trying to trick you. A good TA can really help.","A very interesting man with an amazing life story and career, but besides that a very boring and bad teacher.  All his lectures seem to have come straight from wikipedia and his level of enthusiasm was the equivalent of a brick wall.  I did not enjoy any of the lectures or information.","Reynolds is very engaging and clear. He outlines exactly what he wants you to learn and always tells interesting stories. Not the easiest class, but well worth it.","Great class, great professor. Especially interesting for majors. Reynolds keeps lectures entertaining and his accent doesn't hurt. ;)","Really great class and he does it in a very interesting way. Readings are helpful but it is not necessary to read too thoroughly.","Professor Reynolds' class was very interesting and his lectures were exciting or at least easy to follow.  There is virtually no homework; grades come from three exams and an essay and there is no textbook, but online readings instead.  Highly recommended if you want to learn more about different political systems around the world.","He keeps lectures pretty interesting and jokes around a lot.  Tests aren't really hard, just long.  Fifty minutes is definitely not enough time to write six paragraphs and a clear essay.  There's also a lot of reading involved, but going to recitation helps you understand.","Wonderful teacher.  I looked forward to going to his class.  Extremely knowledgable.  If you don't take a class with him, you have seriously missed out.","very interesting class. great lecturer when he is not off in some third world country teaching them how to be deomcratic. one of the best professors at UNC hands down.","An excellent professor.  I highly recommend this course or any course he is teaching.  Very entertaining and makes class interesting.  Tests are not difficult and attendance is mandatory for lecture/recitation.  If you go to class and keep up with the reading for each class you'll do fine.","Good class, probably more enjoyable for majors. If you are a major I'd say you should definitely take this class or you'll truly miss out.","Great professor, insightful and helpful. He took us out for coffee and discussed world affairs. Definitely going to take some more of his.","A great professor! He keeps class interesting and really knows what he is talking about. My favorite class. The tests really aren't all that difficult as long as you study. I recommend his class.","How da hell can I remember 30 warlords who he only briefly mentions in his lectures, then expect me to write an entire paragraph about them on the test."],"courses":["POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI130","POLI065","POLI130","POLI130"],"courseRatings":["GOOD","AVERAGE","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD","AWESOME","AVERAGE","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","GOOD","AWESOME","AWESOME","GOOD","GOOD","GOOD"]}}]
