I really learned something and she just wants you to do well. I am going to take more of her classes in the future. Highly recommended.","Dr. Adams is a very sweet professor. She really cares more about students scoring well on tests than about making the material hard. Coming to class is important and her tests are passed directly on class powerpoints. She has a review before every test with some of the test questions. She gives online quizzes (easy) and randomly takes attendance."],"courses":["PSYC250","PSYC250"],"courseRatings":["AWESOME","AWESOME"]}}]
